When she returned home a year later armed with ground-breaking research, the insurmountable barriers she faced as a female scientist proved much harder to overcome. In 1972, having published 20 research papers as an assistant professor of zoology at University of Guelph, the Dean of the university, denied her tenure. She couldn't apply to the University of Waterloo because the Dean there told Anne that he would never give tenure to a married woman. This was the catalyst that transformed Anne into a feminist activist. For three decades, Anne Innis Dagg was absent from the giraffe world until 2010 when she was sought out by giraffologists and not just brought back to into the fold, but finally celebrated for her work.	\N	N/A	7.7	123 min	English	21 Mar 2019	True	Alison Reid	Documentary	The Woman Who Loves Giraffes	Canada	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWVmZmEzNmQtNzFmMC00ODU4LWFiMjUtNDdjYjFmYWQ0NDI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI3NDAyNg@@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.7/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"100%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"71/100"}]	276	$113,858	Tatiana Maslany, Victor Garber, Anne Innis Dagg	Alison Reid	2018	N/A	71	\N

In order to stay in the game, he transforms himself into a talent scout and embarks on a mission to bring young and aspiring African players to Europe. Tempting them with big promises that seem impossible to keep, Moses soon finds himself entangled in football's infamous player trade, a system he once loathed himself. Because Moses once too was one of the thousands of African football play- ers that come to Europe to follow in the footsteps of their heroes Sadio Manee, Yaya Touree, Didier Drogba and many others. But only a happy few will succeed in building a professional career on a European football pitch. For every successful African football player, thousands remain in the shadows, not making it professionally, and not able to return to Africa, out of shame and fear of disappointing their families back home. They keep roaming around Europe, with no papers and no safety net. You can find these stranded players on fields in the suburbs of large European cities. There, they train to stay fit, hoping as yet for their breakthrough.	\N	N/A	N/A	N/A	English	10 Sep 2018	True	Maarten Goffin, Louis Pons, Joost Wynant	Documentary	Sideline	Belgium	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA0Y2NlZDktMWI1NS00OWJlLTg3YWQtYjM5OWJlODA4YWRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTE3MTIzMTE@._V1_SX300.jpg	[]	17	N/A	N/A	Maarten Goffin, Louis Pons, Joost Wynant	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt8923484 	\N	Nominated for 1 Oscar. 11 wins & 35 nominations total	In the early 1970s, teenagers with disabilities faced a future shaped by isolation, discrimination and institutionalization. Camp Jened, a ramshackle camp "for the handicapped" in the Catskills, exploded those confines. Jened was their freewheeling Utopia, a place with summertime sports, smoking and makeout sessions awaiting everyone, and campers who felt fulfilled as human beings. Their bonds endured as they migrated West to Berkeley, California - a promised land for a growing and diverse disability community - where friends from Camp Jened realized that disruption and unity might secure life-changing accessibility for millions. Co-directed by Emmy®-winning filmmaker Nicole Newnham and film mixer and former camper Jim LeBrecht, this joyous and exuberant documentary arrives the same year as the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, at a time when the country's largest minority group still battles daily for the freedom to exist. CRIP CAMP: A DISABILITY REVOLUTION is executive produced by President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama; Tonia Davis and Priya Swaminathan; Oscar® nominee Howard Gertler and Ray Lifchez, Jonathan Logan and Patty Quillin; LeBrecht, Newnham and Sara Bolder produce.	\N	R	7.7	106 min	English	25 Mar 2020	True	James Lebrecht, Nicole Newnham, David Radcliff	Documentary, History	Crip Camp	United States	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTNlMDI3MGYtY2FmNy00ZDdmLTkzZDMtMDg1MWYyM2M4YzQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.7/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"100%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"86/100"}]	8,295	N/A	James Lebrecht, Lionel Je'Woodyard, Joseph O'Conor	James Lebrecht, Nicole Newnham	2020	N/A	86	\N

tt8925448 	\N	N/A	Mainstream media have described the Brussels district of Molenbeek as the "jihad capital of Europe," after several suspects in the terrorist attacks on France and Belgium were revealed to have been recruited from its large Muslim community. In the heart of this troubled neighbourhood, Coiffure Zaïdi, a barber shop sitting just opposite a mosque, serves as a meeting place for locals of all ages. This is where award-winning director Sahim Omar Kalifa installed his camera, capturing casual conversations between clients of North African origins. As shocked and dismayed by recent events as anyone else, they discuss unemployment and failed integration, immigration policies and government surveillance. With a fly-on-the-wall approach to these animated debates, and a keen, humanizing eye for the most significant details, Kalifa composes a charming and vivid tableau of a population continually stigmatized and circumscribed by media stereotypes.	\N	N/A	8.2	N/A	Arabic, French	10 May 2018	True	Sahim Omar Kalifa, Bart Maes	Documentary	Cornered in Molenbeek	Belgium	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmJlYjgwYTctMDc5ZC00NWVlLWEzYWMtMWMwMTYxZWVlMDc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE3ODk0NzI3._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.2/10"}]	13	N/A	N/A	Sahim Omar Kalifa	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

It all started in the basement of the Animal House set, where the Toga Party was being filmed with the Northwest's top Blues and Jazz musicians performing as Otis Day's Knights. Later that night, the cast and crew from Animal House followed Bluesman Robert Cray to The Eugene Hotel where he was playing in a splinter group called The Crayhawks with Blues Harp player Curtis Salgado. Before long, Curtis and Belushi became fast friends. But, it was the documentary's filmmaker who pushed Belushi onstage to sing "Hey Bartender" on Halloween, October 31st, 1977. The film then follows the milestone celebrations, including the Guinness Book of Records' World's Largest Toga Party in Cottage Grove.	\N	N/A	8.2	90 min	English	18 Dec 2018	True	Katherine Wilson	Documentary	Animal House of Blues: 33.3 Special Edition	United States	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGNiNTQwNDQtOGZhZS00YjlmLWE1NGYtYmZjYmRjZDVkZmQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTM3MDcyMTA@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.2/10"}]	10	N/A	Robert Bailey, Maida Belove, Dave Berkham	Marv Leake	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt8969332 	\N	15 wins & 27 nominations	A testament to the immense complexity of nature, The Biggest Little Farm follows two dreamers and a dog on an odyssey to bring harmony to both their lives and the land. When the barking of their beloved dog Todd leads to an eviction notice from their tiny LA apartment, John and Molly Chester make a choice that takes them out of the city and onto 200 acres in the foothills of Ventura County, naively endeavoring to build one of the most diverse farms of its kind in complete coexistence with nature. The land they've chosen, however, is utterly depleted of nutrients and suffering from a brutal drought. The film chronicles eight years of daunting work and outsize idealism as they attempt to create the utopia they seek, planting 10,000 orchard trees and over 200 different crops, and bringing in animals of every kind- including an unforgettable pig named Emma and her best friend, Greasy the rooster. When the farm's ecosystem finally begins to reawaken, so does the Chesters' hope - but as their plan to create perfect harmony takes a series of wild turns, they realize that to survive they will have to reach a far greater understanding of the intricacies and wisdom of nature, and of life itself.	\N	PG	8.0	91 min	English, Spanish	10 May 2019	True	Mark Monroe, John Chester	Documentary, Family	The Biggest Little Farm	United States	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ1MjM0OTE2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzgwMDY4NzM@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.0/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"91%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"73/100"}]	9,002	$4,366,949	John Chester, Molly Chester, Todd	John Chester	2018	N/A	73	\N

tt8973144 	\N	N/A	Seeking to build a bridge of mutual understanding and friendship, a Canadian-Egyptian entrepreneur living in Switzerland decides to reach out to the very people who fear him. He travels across the United States to find Americans concerned about an Islamic threat and makes them an intriguing offer: a Free Trip to Egypt. The initial reactions range from disbelief to hostility, but eventually a diverse group from various backgrounds is selected, including: a teacher, a police officer, a Marine veteran, a single mom, a preacher and a beauty pageant queen. All have their preconceptions but are receptive and courageous enough to embark on the adventure of a lifetime. Soon enough, the band of travelers arrives in Egypt where the Americans are paired with local Egyptians just as diverse as they are. What happens when a retired school teacher and her husband are united with a young Egyptian revolutionary? Two photo journalists from different countries and experiences are placed together? A Christian missionary and a former Miss Kentucky from his congregation are joined with an orthodox Muslim family where the mother covers her face? The answers are provocative, surprising, funny, magical, emotional, revealing, enlightening and ultimately life-changing - in other words, all things human - in this profoundly original and inspirational feature-length documentary.	\N	Not Rated	8.0	98 min	English	31 May 2019	True	N/A	Documentary, Adventure, Comedy	Free Trip to Egypt	Switzerland, Egypt, United States	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTk0YzBlNmMtYzg1MC00YzgwLThjOWEtNTQ5YjNmZjk5MGZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzI1MjA2NTM@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.0/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"79%"}]	56	$120,780	Katie Appeldorn, Jenna Day, Ellen Decker	Ingrid Serban	2019	N/A	N/A	\N

tt8973634 	\N	1 win & 3 nominations	This fast-paced, 19 minute short film follows the young husband and wife movie making duo of the determined Scott and perpetually upbeat Eva (played by real life husband and wife, Anthony and Arielle Fanelli) ) as they attempt to make their own independent short film starring and directed by only themselves and maybe their friend/cameraman Austin if he ever shows up. "Juncture" shifts seamlessly back and forth between Scott and Eva "on set" discussing their insecurities and second guessing every creative choice they've made, are making and will make - to then watching the film within the film, "The Debt." "The Debt" tells the tale of the low-level "mobster" duo of the stressed out Lincoln and the hot-head Aiden (who are being played by Scott and Eva, who again are being played by Anthony and Arielle Fanelli). Lincoln and Aiden soon find themselves in way over their heads when a routine gambling debt shakedown results in the unplanned kidnapping of a mysterious man who may or may not have access to a random stash of cash. When word comes from their boss Roni (played in voiceover by Scott and Lincoln's friend Jay, who is played by Jay McKinney) that this mystery man is someone that shouldn't be messed with, the usually indecisive Scott has to make a very quick and life-changing decision. Making movies is hard.	\N	N/A	8.8	19 min	English	01 May 2019	True	Anthony Fanelli	Short, Comedy, Crime	Juncture	United States	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYThjMjcxNjYtMjIwNi00ZGY0LWI5NGItNGViMjMyNjFlZDk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjU2MzQ4MzI@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.8/10"}]	13	N/A	Anthony Fanelli, Arielle Fanelli, Brendan Hannigan	Anthony Fanelli	2019	N/A	N/A	\N

After 50 classified/top secret missions and being wounded 19 times, Capers rose to become one of the most decorated Force Recon Marines in history. Capers and his Force Recon team, aptly named "Team Broadminded" overcame stereotypes and seemingly impossible missions. Capers' story begins childhood, as the son of a sharecropper, through his service as a Force Recon Marine in Vietnam to covert operations in Africa and Eastern Europe. The documentary features raw and honest audio recordings made by Capers in the battlefield, including recently declassified film and photographs that transport the viewer deep into the heart of a faithful warrior, through once classified or top secret missions.	\N	N/A	N/A	88 min	English	14 Feb 2022	True	Ashley Cusato, Mike Gattanella, Kenny Wright Jr.	Documentary	Major Capers: The Legend of Team Broadminded	United States	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM1OGI3ZWQtMDJiNy00ZmVhLWJjNGEtZDVlNzcyMDJlNGM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTIxMzY1OQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg	[]	N/A	N/A	Ronald L.

tt8982428 	\N	2 wins & 3 nominations	In Vidarbha, the eastern region of Maharashtra, the period between Diwali and Holi is when farmers retire from the fields and seek entertainment and recreation. The tradition of zhaadi-patti theatre, referred to as Zollywood, takes over - a Rs. 400 crore industry that seemingly springs up overnight, with daily performances till the arrival of spring. We get a look into this world through the eyes of a group of enterprising people in the sleepy hamlet of Vadsa over three years in the early 2000s. Raja and Deepak are two such dreamers, who run a 'press' (production company) together; however, because of Raja's dalliances with one of his actresses at the expense of their work, Deepak and veteran zhaadi-patti actor Narayan Rao part ways and form their own press. As time passes, fortunes swing and lives change, both for better and for worse, but the show never stops for these zhaadi-patti artists.	\N	N/A	N/A	N/A	Marathi	03 Jun 2022	True	Trushant Ingle, Asawari Naidu	Drama	Zollywood	India	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjBkNmI2NzYtZTc2Yi00ZjZjLThmYTUtNjFmOTE1Yjk4MTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDUyMTExMzg@._V1_SX300.jpg	[]	31	N/A	Nisha Dhongade, Dinkar Gavande, Rahul Gawande	Trushant Ingle	2022	N/A	N/A	\N

tt8986906 	\N	N/A	In August of 2009 singer William McCarthy's younger brother James, in the midst of a lengthy incarceration on charges of attempted murder, was found dead of an apparent suicide inside Napa State Hospital. Just one week later, McCarthy's band Pela imploded, leaving both him and band mate Eric Sanderson devastated, in financial ruin, and with a half-finished album that may never see the light of day. RISE: The Story of Augustines chronicles the journey of two men who faced their demons, refused to fall and established a lifelong brotherhood as they struggled to finish their seminal debut record, all while trying to maintain their own sanity and pay tribute to James. McCarthy's songwriting during the toughest year of his life would come to be known as his defining work. The album Rise Ye Sunken Ships stands as a testament both to the pain of loss and the celebration of life. The two resurfaced with a new name, Augustines and, together with drummer Robert Allen, who shepherded William and Eric through their darkest of times, rose up to become one of the most celebrated independent bands in the world. This is a truly compelling story of struggle, perseverance, brotherhood and hope.	\N	N/A	9.4	80 min	English	N/A	True	N/A	Documentary, Music	RISE: The Story of Augustines	United States	23 May 2019	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJkNDc4NWMtNWY1My00MjUzLTkzMTktMGM2YmY0MzFhOTg3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTgxMTQ3ODM@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"9.4/10"}]	80	N/A	Robert Allen, William Mccarthy, John Richards	Todd Howe	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt8988994 	\N	N/A	Shinaakht is short film based on Circumcision and Short Film Shinaakht Challenges the custom of cutting Gentile part as identification of religion as this is nowhere mentioned in holy book Quran. Shinaakht's story tracks a close relationship between a father and his two kids (Idrish and Sofiya), who were circumcised at the age of 8 and 9 respectively as per the religious customs and traditions. On attaining the adult age, they file a case against their father - Liaqat Ali, Maulvi Muhammad Basheer, who insisted Liaqat to undergo circumcision of kids as this practice is mandatory in Islam as per the Quraan, and Zarra Jumman Miyan, an illiterate and unprofessional person who carried out circumcisions. When matters come to the Mumbai High Court, Liaqat chooses to stand up in support of the children and of the constitutional laws of India. Liaqat was not willing to undergo with circumcision of his children but social pressure specially compression from Maulana Muhammad Basheer who explained Liaqat that circumcision is a mandatory custom for Muslims and his kids can not be treated as Muslims unless they are circumcised. Liaqat feels guilty when he faces the facts that circumcision was carried out in unhygienic conditions which affected the kids seriously and they have suffered health issues after that and he feels even more burdened by the guilt when Liaqat learns that circumcision is not a mandatory practices to carry out as per the religion. Idrish and Sofiya put their foot down for their fundamental rights in the court and they demand for justice and explain to the court and to those present that the practice is a "violent and painful experience" and against their constitutional rights. Applicants seek remedies from the court and plea to ban on this practice as this is not as per The Constitution of India and demand justice as per the provision of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956, POCSO Act and Section 326 and 326A of the Indian Penal Code, court listens to all the parties and come to a decision, which is not revealed and the film stops with question to the audience.	\N	N/A	N/A	40 min	Hindi	01 Nov 2018	True	Pragyesh Singh	Short, Drama	Shinaakht	India	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY5NDg5MmQtYjY3Mi00NDZiLTkxY2UtMmE5YTc1NzEzNTNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzAzNjI5NDA@._V1_SX300.jpg	[]	N/A	N/A	Raju Kher, Shishir Sharma, Shakti Singh	Pragyesh Singh	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt8991254 	\N	N/A	En route to an international competition, Closing The Gap follows the North Korean men's hockey team as they strive to bring home gold for Marshal Kim Jong Un. While their commitment and dedication to their training is unmatched, they're hard pressed to catch a break. Whether it be the UN sanctions on North Korea, or the flurry of injuries and rumours that plague the DPRK team, this film is a window into the lives of a group of underdog athletes. With the weight of their country's history and reputation on their shoulders, they struggle to seek that which we all seek - self-worth. Unlike any other film produced on North Korea, Closing The Gap is a lyrical composition which hybridizes elements of sport documentary (Last Chance U) with real-time, changing perspectives (White Helmets). The result is an honest portrayal of what these athletes feel and experience as they foray into the wider world beyond the DPRK. In what is the first recorded account of North Korea allowing foreigners access to any sports club, this intimate look reveals blissful subtleties of character from a regime not conducive to individuality.	\N	N/A	9.1	68 min	Korean	05 Dec 2019	True	Nigel Edwards	Documentary, Sport	Closing the Gap: Hockey in North Korea	Canada	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2JhZjY2NmQtMjBhZS00NDZmLTlmZDctMzdlMDRiMDg3ZWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDQ0NTE3Mjk@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"9.1/10"}]	8	N/A	N/A	Nigel Edwards	2019	N/A	N/A	\N

tt8991262 	\N	2 wins & 7 nominations	In the concrete jungle that is Beirut, people suffer at the hand of what's dubbed to be the most corrupt government in the Middle East. Decades of wars have left the tiny city with a crumbling infrastructure, inflation, the poverty line is rising and the conflicts in neighboring Syria have forced over 1.5M refugees to flee into the country. Abu Housam is an elderly Palestinian taxi driver who works and sleeps in his car, drinking araq and cracking witty jokes at the city outside his window. He abandoned his family to live alone knowing they're better off without him. Heartbroken from a recent loss of a lover, he struggles to focus on his goal of buying his own car, a shelter for his future. Eleven year old Syrian refugee Ali has chosen to live alone on the streets, calling them his freedom. He loves the sea and his friend Azzam, who has gone missing, and is constantly waiting for his return. The unmarried Lebanese woman Samya lives with her family in a tiny room. Struggling to make ends meet, Samya tries to care for her mother, who is going blind from glaucoma. Under Beirut's umbrella of corruption and chaos, "Underdown" follows the three resilient characters on a pulsating journey through their daily struggles living with poverty. Stuck in dark loops of violence, social injustice and alcohol abuse, they connect in their search for hope, freedom and happiness.	\N	N/A	7.4	72 min	Arabic	16 Nov 2018	True	Sarah Kaskas	Documentary	Underdown	Germany, Lebanon, Qatar	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1ZTdhNmUtOTEwZC00MmEzLWIyNDctMzhmZDQ4MTY5YmM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQ0MTg3MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.4/10"}]	17	N/A	N/A	Sarah Kaskas	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

Since the Tsunami hit the northern part of Japan's coast in 2011, more than 20 thousand people lost their lives, and many others are still missing. As time went by the families of the victims abandoned all hope and stopped looking for their loved ones. However, this is the story of two men that are still fully committed to their respective searching activities. Even though their backgrounds are extremely different, both share a strong force of will and firmly wish to keep alive the memories of the ones that went missing. Perseverance is what pushed an ex-convict to look for redemption by helping the victims' families to find the remains of their loved ones, and perseverance is what brought a bus driver to start to dive in order to search for his wife.	\N	N/A	7.8	78 min	Japanese	11 Mar 2020	True	Simone Spampinato, Lorenzo Squarcia	Documentary, Drama	Koi	Italy, Japan	23 Apr 2020	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE4NGY2NWYtZGU0OC00MWFjLTg1MGYtOTFlZGNkZjU2ZmI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTI0OTM0MDM@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"}]	107	N/A	Tomohiro Narita, Yasuo Takamatsu, Yuichiro Ito	Lorenzo Squarcia	2019	N/A	N/A	\N

tt8997170 	\N	1 win & 2 nominations	For over 120 years hundreds of thousands of black men from the countries of Southern Africa have left their families to dig for gold and produce the wealth of South Africa. Today these mining communities face severe poverty and the world's greatest epidemic of silicosis and tuberculosis caused by exposure to silica dust in gold mines. The true cost of South Africa's wealth is revealed by the juxta-positioning of present day gold miner stories with an archival voice created from state and mining records and repurposed industrial documentaries and propaganda films. The archival voice further reveals the untold story of how industrialised South Africa was built on a foundation of modern slavery based on a vast system of recruitment that utilized propaganda films since the early 1900's. Dying for Gold is also a story of mad love that holds men, women and children through experiences of unspeakable pain and death.	\N	N/A	7.6	99 min	Xhosa, Sotho, English	16 Oct 2018	True	N/A	Documentary	Dying for Gold	South Africa	13 Jul 2021	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ1NDg2YWEtZWJkNC00ZDNmLWI1ZWQtYmQyZjhkODEwNzM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE4ODc5Mzc@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"}]	14	N/A	N/A	Catherine Meyburgh, Richard Pakleppa	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt8999372 	\N	1 nomination	A revealing and deeply personal documentary about the life of Sir Alex Ferguson, from his working-class roots in Glasgow to his career as one of the greatest football managers of all time. While recovering from a traumatic brain hemorrhage, Sir Alex intimately recounts details of his life and career to his son, including his legendary 26-year tenure as manager of Manchester United. Directed by Sir Alex's son, Jason Ferguson, this is a moving story about the extraordinary power of memory. Alex recalls his career vividly - every trophy, every defeat, and every player. From his own successful playing career and prolific goal-scoring at Scottish clubs, including Rangers, to his move into management and leading Aberdeen to the European Cup Winners' Cup, and then finally his move south to Old Trafford. After a testing few years at United, he turned the club's fortunes around and led them to over two decades of consistent success. Under Ferguson's guidance, Manchester United won a glittering array of trophies, including 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, and two UEFA Champions League titles. He has won more trophies than any other manager in football history. The film features candid interviews with Alex himself, his wife Cathy, his three sons, as well as former colleagues and elite players including Eric Cantona, Ryan Giggs and Gordon Strachan. This is a film about the bond between a father and son, an exploration of leadership and mental toughness, and a celebration of one of football's greatest careers.	\N	PG-13	8.1	108 min	English	29 May 2021	True	Mark Monroe	Documentary, Biography, Sport	Sir Alex Ferguson: Never Give In	United Kingdom	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA3NmI4MzktODYyOS00ZWZhLWEzYjUtZjBlZjgyZTE4M2MwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTEyNjg4MzI@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"100%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"68/100"}]	6,152	N/A	Eric Cantona, Alex Ferguson, Manchester United F.C.

LAPD veteran Detective Coleman (Slink Johnson) grew up in the Oakwood district of Venice, a crime-ridden side of LA that Hollywood never sees. Coleman grew up immersed in the gang culture and mentality that still plagues the community, but as a teenager something changed: he lost a close friend, and almost lost his own life to a gang shooting. Ever since, he's made it his life mission to pay it forward. Baby Gangsta, known as BG, lives in the same neighborhood Detective Coleman grew up in. Coleman watches BG... he sees himself in BG - the same choices, the same mistakes, and the same potential to make it out of a dead-end life. Meanwhile, as Crips, BG and his childhood friend Slim are being drafted into war with their rivals across town, the Bloods. Especially Big Poppa (Mitchy Slick) and his road dog Goon (Compton Menace) who are on a quest for blood after BG slaps Big Poppa's sister... that's how easy it is to start a gang war on the mean streets of LA. Under the ever-watchful eye of Detective Coleman, will BG choose a never-ending cycle of crime, violence and destruction, or can he escape his seemingly destined path for a new way of life?	\N	N/A	9.0	69 min	English	11 Sep 2020	True	Damond Collier	Crime, Drama	Baby Gangsta	United States	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGI0OWFmM2YtMDA5Yi00YzkwLThhMTQtZDYxYTk3ZjRlOWNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk4MzI5NDI@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"9.0/10"}]	21	N/A	Leroy Bolts, Shatecia Broughton, Damiyon Brown	Damond Collier, Juan Mabson, Rene Villar Rios	2020	N/A	N/A	\N

Her husband, a senior Doctor, spends most of his time doing relief work in surrounding areas, leaving her alone at home to take care of their son. One day, she meets Sumon, a young PhD student researching food habits in northeastern India, who warms up to her in a manner she seems unaccustomed to. Sumon's work exposes him to the belief that there's no kind of food that can be considered abnormal, and Nirmali is drawn to this idea.

Together, they bond over meals comprising unusual meats on platonic dates, although Sumon longs for some sort of physical contact.

tt9011346 	\N	N/A	This honest and often blackly hilarious film shows musical maverick, John Martyn at home in Ireland, during the lead-up to and aftermath of an operation to have one of his legs amputated below the knee. Contributors include sometime collaborator and buddy Phil Collins, the late Robert Palmer, Ralph McTell, Island Records founder Chris Blackwell, fellow hellraiser bassist Danny Thompson, John's ex-wife Beverley Martyn and younger generation fan Beth Orton. We see a man incapable of compromising his creative vision, from his folk club roots in the Sixties, through a career of continuous musical experimentation. Along the way there is a surreal roll-call of accidents and incidents, including a collision with a cow.	\N	N/A	N/A	60 min	English	10 Feb 2004	True	N/A	Documentary	John Martyn: Johnny Too Bad	United Kingdom	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmM0YWUyNDQtOTIxNy00NjI0LWJjYWYtMGVlZmU3ODc2ZGE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzIzODM3ODQ@._V1_SX300.jpg	[]	13	N/A	Chris Blackwell, Phil Collins, Gizmo the Dog	Serena Cross	2004	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9020228 	\N	1 nomination	For centuries, the tobacco pipe has been a symbol of contentment and contemplation. Through the window of this transcendental artifact and its sacred origins, Father the Flame is a cinematic exploration of legacy, family and love. The film follows Lee Erck, a world-renowned pipe maker from far Northern Michigan, as he travels the globe to explore the nearly forgotten art of tobacco pipe making. Featuring a charming cast of characters-from the royal family of Danish pipe makers, to the Italian briar cutter known as the worlds greatest, to a fourth-generation Native American peace pipe maker- this story speaks to a slower pace of life, a luxury in our sped-up world. Beautiful and hypnotic, Father the Flame immerses the viewer in the cultural and spiritual significance of the tobacco pipe and what it can teach a modern generation about legacy and the things we leave behind.	\N	Not Rated	7.6	78 min	English	04 Jun 2019	True	David Michael Phelps	Documentary	Father the Flame	United States	07 Jun 2019	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGEyZDM5OTktZGUzZC00Y2MyLWJlN2ItZTUwMTIwYmQ1NDRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTQ1MTMzMjI@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"}]	63	N/A	Frank Burla, Karin Domenico, Pippo Domenico	Chad Terpstra	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

So, while Atomic Dialogues is a frugally crafted docu-comedy with a clear educational purpose and an unprecedented selection of rare archive footage; it is also a passionate invitation to everyone who craves to take a peek inside the daily life of those people who have chosen to dedicate their entire lives to ask questions in the name of knowledge.	\N	N/A	8.2	84 min	Italian	01 May 2018	True	Felice Farina, Nicolas di Valerio	Documentary	Conversazioni atomiche	Italy	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2YyOTE0NTAtODk3Ni00ODcyLTlkZWEtNTRhOWJkNGUyZmRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjEwMjk4Mjc@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.2/10"}]	5	N/A	N/A	Felice Farina	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9037804 	\N	N/A	School Circles is an independent documentary that explores the practice of democratic schools in the Netherlands. The film shows students, teachers and staff members coming together to dialogue, discuss proposals, mediate conflicts and make decisions about their school life. However these schools not only challenge the mainstream education, but also democracy as we know it. They put into practice Sociocracy, a method for collective organization based on self-regulating systems, in which the decisions are made through consent. School Circles connects the theory of sociocracy to its practice within schools, taking us to new possibilities of organizing ourselves and our communities.	\N	N/A	N/A	89 min	English	01 Aug 2018	True	N/A	Documentary	School Circles	Netherlands	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjQyYWIzYWItMmFiYy00MzE5LWI1NjktYjhiOTMxODBkMWZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQyMTMxODQ@._V1_SX300.jpg	[]	18	N/A	N/A	Marianne Osorio, Charlie Shread	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9038854 	\N	N/A	In 2011, Pocomoke City a small town on Maryland's Lower Eastern Shore hired Kelvin Sewell, its first African-American police chief. Sewell, a former Baltimore city homicide investigator and narcotics officer had grown tired of the aggressive tactics used by the Baltimore Police Department...particularly those targeting black communities. Determined to deploy a different approach to law enforcement, Sewell implemented an intensive community policing plan. He and his officers parked their cars and walked the streets. Sewell's system worked: crime plummeted. Residents both black and white became ardent supporters of Sewell's new paradigm of policing. But a conflict was brewing; an ongoing dispute over racial discrimination engulfed Sewell and his officers in a battle that would not only cost them their jobs and professional reputations, but would thrust them into an emotional legal battle that would touch all segments of the community.	\N	PG-13	N/A	77 min	English	21 Oct 2019	True	Stephen Janis	Documentary	The Friendliest Town	United States	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA1NzYzOTYtMzAxNS00MTJhLTgyNGItMzNhYmNiYmQ2YjI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTYzMjM0OA@@._V1_SX300.jpg	[]	18	N/A	Diane Downing, Stephen Janis, Kelvin Sewell	Stephen Janis	2019	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9048474 	\N	N/A	While the debate continues about GMOs, Roundup and other toxic pesticides, this powerful film shares remarkable stories of people who regain their health after discovering the secret ingredients in their food and making a bold commitment to avoid them. At the heart of the story is Kathleen DiChiara who always worked out and ate right - or so she thought. When her health and the health of her family fell apart, she was determined to figure out why. When she discovered the secret ingredients hidden in their food and removed them, the results were dramatic. The film shares many other powerful stories of people who regained their health after changing to an all organic diet, free of GMOs, Roundup and other toxic pesticides. Skin rashes cleared up; tumors disappeared; digestive issues settled down; infertile couples now have happy babies; cancer patients are now cancer free; and autistic children are now off the spectrum. These experiences are backed up by physicians, scientists and experts who explain the science, and the political history, of GMOs and pesticides - particularly Roundup and the key ingredient, glyphosate, which is sprayed on many crops and ends up on our table. Artfully directed by Amy Hart and leading anti-GMO consumer advocate, Jeffrey Smith, this film is the perfect blend of heartfelt stories and scientific information that may inspire you to ask, What could happen if I removed the secret ingredients from my kitchen?	\N	N/A	8.4	80 min	English	18 Oct 2018	True	Amy S Hart, Jeffrey M.

When he almost loses his first fight, his dreams are suddenly questioned. Malcolm's coach Jessie (43), still mourning his own shattered boxing career, fears to fail a second time. They intensify the training drastically, almost heading towards a path of self-destruction. It becomes clear that talent, passion and even hard work sometimes are not enough to succeed. It's the family around you - nobody can make it alone. In LET THE BELL RING the classical story of a boxer's dream becomes a generation's tale about first and last hopes, set against the backdrop of Los Angeles.

tt9056798 	\N	1 win & 5 nominations	This film charts the final year in office of South Africa's Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela, as she attempts to bring justice to ordinary people. After successfully challenging President Zuma for illegal use of state funds, she now has to face the biggest challenge of her career: investigating - in the face of protests, death threats and legal challenges - the alleged systematic takeover of government by a private family in cahoots with the President. But how does one weigh the importance of fighting government corruption against the larger moral crime of continued inequality? WHISPERING TRUTH TO POWER documents the tense story of Madonsela's last year in public office while simultaneously crafting an absorbing tale of an outstanding lawyer, mother and woman, and also providing insight into several critical issues facing South Africa today, such as ongoing inequality, racial tensions, land redistribution, and corruption.	\N	N/A	N/A	87 min	English, Sotho, Zulu	27 Apr 2018	True	Shameela Seedat	Documentary	Whispering Truth to Power	South Africa, Netherlands	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDNlODU4N2EtYjQ4Ni00MDI1LTlkMzYtYWQwMDJjZjUxNTEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA3MzU2NTcx._V1_SX300.jpg	[]	15	N/A	N/A	Shameela Seedat	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9056804 	\N	2 wins	The focus of DADA on Vacation is the German performer and poet Emmy Hennings and the poet and artist Hugo Ball, who would later become her husband. The film is a fictional portrayal of the early stages of their relationship. They go on vacation together for the first time, travelling to a deserted village - absurdly - on Segways. All the houses are empty. Only large-format paper works of art hang on the facades of the buildings. This Dadaesque vacation film is shown at a party in Hugo's apartment. While the Dadaists at the party playfully give themselves roles in their distant stylization, Hugo Ball and Emmy Hennings remain true to themselves, right up to the balcony scene with fireworks. The closing credits, which last for five minutes, are a mélange of film fiction, credits and making-of. Only now does the viewer realise that the strangely deserted village is a place that has been depopulated for big money, a place that was destroyed by the huge bucket excavators of the Garzweiler II open-cast mining complex. Here we see the political, critical side of Dada.	\N	N/A	9.6	28 min	None	N/A	True	Errkaa	Short	Dada on Vacation	Germany	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzZkM2NiZTktM2Q0Ni00N2RjLTgyOGMtMjIyZDg3ZjhkNzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkzNTk3NjY@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"9.6/10"}]	10	N/A	Rachel Avila, Brozilla, Errkaa	Errkaa	2016	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9059202 	\N	2 wins	Kuch Der Aur (Wait a while) is a film showing the momentary lives of the people in Chandni Chowk. The film follows the journey of a young boy trying to find a moment of bliss in his life filled with impassiveness and eternal wait that the thousands of lives in Chandni Chowk are accustomed to. The transcending wait continues to test his patience and that of the other lives around him like his mother waiting for a relief from her silent life, his Chacha hoping to get out of his middle age crises and his Chachi longing for a son she could never have. Each one has to try their own way out of this never ending cycle of wait. The film also tries to seep inwards into the lives of the people in Chandni Chowk and internalize their experiences of desperate longing and wait, and presents it through a tinge of observational cinema.	\N	N/A	8.7	65 min	Hindi	30 Sep 2018	True	Anurag Kawatra	Drama	Kuch Der Aur	India	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODJjODUzZWItM2VlZC00OTJmLThkMmUtMTI0YWUzNjZhMDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTMwOTY4Mzk@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.7/10"}]	42	N/A	Meenu Kawatra, Saajan Kataria, Rajesh Navgain	Anurag Kawatra	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9059688 	\N	2 wins	In the late 80's, at the same time the world was witnessing the fall of the Berlin Wall, down south, Brazil was getting back its democracy. Major changes were coming not only to the country's political life, but also to its untouchable cultural heritage, the Brazilian music. A new generation of artists decided to defy the status quo and immerse in a new not-so-Brazilian genre, transforming permanently the Brazilian musical scenario with their noisy guitars, lyrics in English and vigorous performances. Singing in Portuguese was not an option anymore, even if that meant being disowned by the mainstream media for good.	\N	N/A	9.7	86 min	Portuguese, English	01 Jan 2019	True	Caio Augusto Braga	Documentary, Music	Guitar Days - An Unlikely Story of Brazilian Music	Brazil, United Kingdom	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg3NDNiNTktN2VlZC00OGJmLWJjZjgtMTZhM2E4MjY1YWY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzAxNTI3Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"9.7/10"}]	35	N/A	Zé Antonio Algodoal, Carol Alleoni, Guilherme Almeida	Caio Augusto Braga	2019	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9059838 	\N	3 wins	"Repeat Offender" is based on author Bradley Nickell's best selling true crime book and tells the story of Daimon Monroe, mastermind of the most prolific theft ring in Las Vegas history. Over the course of 15 years, Monroe specialized in commercial burglaries, amassing millions in cash and stolen property from his criminal enterprise. Many have labeled him the poster child for a Habitual Criminal. "Repeat Offender" follows the real life investigation led by Detective Nickell, as the elite Repeat Offender Program (ROP) unit closes in on Monroe and his co-conspirators. The viewer sits in the detective's chair, listening to jail phone calls and suspect interviews, which are supported by courtroom testimony and new interviews with the people who worked on the case. All of which leads to a Murder for Hire plot where Monroe attempts to have Detective Nickell, the prosecutor, and the judge killed for revenge. Perhaps proving the line between a violent and non violent criminal is forever blurred.	\N	N/A	9.3	80 min	English	N/A	True	Jason Harney, Bradley Nickell	Documentary	Repeat Offender	N/A	28 Jun 2019	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2M5OWY4MDMtZWI2Zi00MmI1LWI1MDAtYWFkMjA0ODYzNDM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjEwMjExNTI@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"9.3/10"}]	23	N/A	Sandra Allred-DiGiacomo, Stewart Bell, Bob Cayne	Jason Harney	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

Caged in a life that only promises her an uncertain future. Carmela perceives her adolescence as captivity, forced to live as a prisoner by her mother, Maria, who forces her to sell drugs along with her older brother, Ciro. War breaks out amongst the gangs in the neighborhood and Carmela is forced to stay indoors, with the windows well sealed, and give up everything, even one of the things she loves the most, going to school. Powerless in the face of the circumstances that ferry her to an uncertain destiny, made of fear, refusal, co-living surrounded by crime, Carmela attempts to escape confessing everything to her best friend, her diary. The difficult reality, in which the little protagonist lives, slowly compromises her purity and her innocence, almost like an unavoidable consequence of the rotten and deviated context in which she grows. Ultimately making her not only an accomplice but also a slave to that reality, the only one who she knows, resigning herself to it.	\N	N/A	N/A	92 min	N/A	05 Jul 2019	True	Vincenzo Caiazzo	Drama	Carmela's diary	Italy	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTI2MzExNGMtNGI4Ny00NGZhLTk1MWMtZGY2ZWUzOGU1ZWY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjAwNzI4NzU@._V1_SX300.jpg	[]	5	N/A	Mariasole Di Maio, Titti Nuzzolese, Mariacarla Casillo	Vincenzo Caiazzo	2019	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9074318 	\N	3 wins	SON RISE is filmed in the strongly patriarchal state of Haryana, bordering India's capital, New Delhi. Illegal, yet rampant female foeticide has led to the eerie absence of girls in hundreds of villages. This skewed sex-ratio has provoked an unprecedented number of crimes against women - with the highest number of gang rapes reported in the country. Exploring these darkest corners, the film maker discovers that all is not lost: there are men who are rising to fight for women's justice. And perhaps, for the first time in their lives, are realising their greatest fight is with other men, whom they will have to combat at every step of the way. From a forward-thinking village chief and father of two daughters, fighting for women to enter the male-dominated arena of local politics - to a farmer who, in an arranged marriage, defies society by marrying a gang rape survivor.

The film is about his mentor Vikram Rana, who is a police suspect and also the kingpin of the city's crime cartel, about which Karan is not aware. Karan investigates a series of odd occurrences in the city, including the murder of Jaydev Rana (Vikram Rana's son). The deeper he digs into the clues, the more complex it gets. Everyone he trusts seems to be involved and the investigation yields no results.

At the heart of the story is the band's unshakeable brotherhood which has endured through many highs and lows. The film is directed by Mat Whitecross - director of Supersonic, the acclaimed 2016 Oasis documentary - who met the four friends at college in London, before they'd even formed the band. From the very first rehearsal in a cramped student bedroom, Whitecross has been there to capture the music and the relationships on tape. Using extensive unseen archive, behind-the-scenes and live footage, A HEAD FULL OF DREAMS sees the band reflect upon their two decades together. It was filmed during Coldplay's record-breaking A Head Full Of Dreams Tour, which was certified as the third biggest tour of all time, playing to more than 5.5 million fans across the world.	\N	PG-13	7.9	115 min	English	16 Nov 2018	True	N/A	Documentary, Music	Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams	United Kingdom	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyOTg2MzE0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDcyNDQ5NjM@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"50%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"64/100"}]	3,489	N/A	Guy Berryman, Beyoncé, Jon Buckland	Mat Whitecross	2018	N/A	64	\N

tt9105600 	\N	N/A	Miha Celar's film IOtok is not just very enjoyable to watch, it is also and intense film about a survival fight of 13 last residents of a small Bisevo island in the southern part of croatian coast. The acting is excellent. As a matter of fact, as director has said, the film creators have used a method of observation - they've just filmed what they observed. But as a viewer I got the feeling that all characters in the movie were well known actors. They made you hope that their survival story and their war would end in a way we want it to.Beside famous Slovenian writer Mate Dolenc we can "observe" other Bisevo residents: young couple - Chef Lado and his girlfriend Lucia; local guide Zvonko, who shows off the island's hidden beauties just to tourists that he likes; island's poet and chronicler Mico Finta; newcomer Sandi, who camps in the ruined house and strives to catch his first squid; Vlado - teacher who takes his pupils on a final excursion to Bisevo and teaches them how to salt the fish ... and some others "Bisevians" who are more original and heart touching then the weirdest characters in a Coen Brothers movie.The film is a marvellous example of team work. Director and screenwriter Miha Celar deftly interlaced amazing people into an intense environmental drama. Tomislav Krnic's poetic photography masterly combined the sea and the sky and Luca Ciute's music gently melted all into a real pleasure and gets us going about the environment.	\N	N/A	8.5	90 min	Croatian	14 Sep 2018	True	Tamara Babun, Miha Celar	Documentary	iIsland	Slovenia, Croatia, Italy	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDhkMDliNzUtNGQyZS00YjM5LTg2YTQtZWVjOTkxODZjOWE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQxNzY5NTc@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.5/10"}]	14	N/A	Mate Dolenc	Miha Celar	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

Apart from that, he has been a member of the Taiwanese parliament since 2016, sitting on the committees for National Defence and Foreign Affairs. He is a member of a coalition working closely with Taiwan's first-ever female president. The film accompanies the rock star politician for his first year in political office as he opposes China's policy towards Taiwan and Tibet. As an activist fighting for human rights, he meets with the Dalai Lama, but also takes part in Donald Trump's inauguration even though he has many reservations about him. Freddy Lim is on the front line. But he still occasionally puts on his face paint and sings in a diabolical voice at the front of his black metal band.

tt9151364 	\N	N/A	'The Tempest' is one of my favourite Shakespeare plays. It contains one of his most imaginative settings, which can be truly wondrous with the right budget and in terms of character dynamics and genre it is unique. Again, Shakespeare's mastery of text is evident throughout with many memorable, iconic in some cases, lines, speeches and scenes. And the characters are not easy to forget, with the play boasting two of for me Shakespeare's greatest characters in Prospero and Caliban.Stratford's 2019 production is an absolute dream and as far as productions of 'The Tempest' go, this is among the best of them and of the filmed Stratford productions it's one of the best too. It captures all the charm and magic, as well as the fun and poignancy, of the play and adds plenty of its own. Like other filmed Stratford productions, there is plenty for traditionalists and those already familiar with 'The Tempest' to enjoy. While also providing plenty to enjoy for those not familiar in a way that is accessible yet tasteful.Visually, the production is quite stunning. Not just the twinkling tree lighting or the magically atmospheric yet never overblown sets, but also the very colourful and inventively designed costumes. Have not seen such unique costuming for the Roman Goddesses especially. The music has mysterious eeriness but enchanting beauty as well, perfectly fitting the many complex moods of the play and any gear changes are seamless rather than a hodge-podge.No problems can be found with Shakespeare's writing, much of it is out of this world and the best quotes are some of his most iconic. Text that is delivered beautifully and adapted with faithfulness and no issue with coherence. The staging has more than enough to make it stand out in its own way, especially the character dynamics with the most insightful (in a way unlike any production of 'The Tempest' seen) being the one being between Prospero and Miranda. It also succeeds in making the enchantment come alive, not overplaying the comedy and giving the drama a lot of heart.The most talked about touch is Prospero being female, this gender reversal is not a new idea for Shakespeare productions in recent years (Royal Shakespeare Company did this in many recent productions with varied success) but this is one of the most successful and most insightful attempts and made me see the character in a whole new light. This production of 'The Tempest' felt fresh but was also done in good taste and made sense, which are the most important things when doing something different from the usual.All the performances are super too, with the standout being the masterful Prospero of Martha Henry, the role is a very complex one which is performed with restrained authority and nuance. Michael Blake makes one feel repulsed and pitiful towards Caliban, while Andre Morin is an amorous and full of life Ariel. Sebastien Heins and Mamie Zwettler make for charming, but not passive, lovers and the comedic roles don't fall into the trap of being over-played or annoying, the comedy here being effortlessly funny.In conclusion, brilliant. 10/10.	\N	N/A	7.8	N/A	English	17 Mar 2019	True	William Shakespeare	Drama	The Tempest	Canada	23 Mar 2017	N/A	\N	movie	N/A	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"}]	20	N/A	Graham Abbey, Michael Blake, Farhang Ghajar	Barry Avrich	2019	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9164818 	\N	N/A	Imagine if you had something like The Avengers movies but removing all the inconsistencies such as picking up characters from very different fictional worlds, instead, you had a consistent integrated story that made perfect sense inside its universe of magic and technology. In fact, the use of terms such as nanotechnology in fiction is just another way of saying magic and this movie expresses this idea very well.In terms of plot this movie is the second part of the story that began in Reflection. Every mystery of the first movie is explained and made clear. Torwards the end it gets very emotional, overall, I almost cried watching some scenes.Yes, it has some issues, mostly relating to its very conventional direction and the transformation sequences go too long for their own good. Howerver, I am not cutting points for this because the movie never tried to be something experimental and indulgence in transformation sequences is Nanoha's franchise defining characteristic.	\N	N/A	7.6	111 min	Japanese	19 Oct 2018	True	Masaki Tsuzuki	Animation, Action, Fantasy	Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha: Detonation	Japan	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTU5ZWFkZDQtOGZkMC00NTI2LWI2Y2ItNTdmMTkzY2U0MjI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzEyMDQ1MDA@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"}]	45	N/A	Kana Asumi, Yôko Hikasa, Kazuya Ichijô	Takayuki Hamana	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9178978 	\N	N/A	The world was left without a sun in the sky, and the only way to survive was to cover up everything in bright artificial lights, lights created to bury as much darkness as possible. The lights have replaced the need for the sun now, and people have even started to forget about it, and even talking about the darkness is taboo. But an artist, Sneha, feels out of place in this strange new world of dancing lights, and her only comfort is the myth that there is still a place, hidden from plain sight, where you can see the sun again. Nobody knows where this place is, or how to get there, and most believe it only exists as a myth. So, when a visitor to Sneha's art gallery finds out the pieces of darkness hidden subtly in all her art, pieces even she hadn't noticed before, the darkness starts to grow up on her literally. She is then confronted with the choice of whether to face the darkness which is growing up on her, or to run away from it, as everyone tells her to. Beyond the darkness is the promise of reaching the hidden mythical land where the sun can be seen again. But that would mean facing her past, which she had buried deep inside her darkness.	\N	N/A	N/A	63 min	English	N/A	True	Aditya Chowdhury	Drama, Fantasy, Sci-Fi	Eclipsed	India	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTQxZWZjN2MtNWQyOC00NDVlLTgyMGMtYzRmNDFiMzA2YzY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzg2MjY0Mjc@._V1_SX300.jpg	[]	6	N/A	Kanika Gupta, Soumya Chakrabarti, Aishwarya Walvekar	Aditya Chowdhury	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9191204 	\N	1 win & 1 nomination	Paivi is in her 50's and lives on Aland, an island in Finland with 30 000 people. We have our own government which can decide some things independently of the Finnish government: taxes, hunting, gambling etc. Paivi is a single mother and when her boys move out she is alone. She looks for company online and finds gambling. She gets addicted. She is an accountant and has access to money. Things go out of hand. Suddenly she has lost 819 000 - of her clients money! She is caught and it is a big scandal. She tries to commit suicide but gets jail. The clients are angry, they trusted her! It gets worse. It turns out she lost it all to the local gambling company. They hold a monopoly license to prevent from addiction and criminality - exactly what they didn't. The money went to the local government and they distributed it to the people: to football associations, research etc. It all turns into a money laundry case, the first in Finnish legal history to involve a gambling company. But the government refuses to pay back the money which make Paivis former clients furious. The movie had a preview on Aland where it ran for four days and won the audience award. Public opinion became strong and the government now have to plan on how to pay back and how to prevent this from happening again. But people get addicted to gambling everyday. Right now someone is losing everything. Right now, a gambler filled with guilt tries to kill herself. This is just the story of one gambler.	\N	N/A	7.2	76 min	Swedish	07 Mar 2018	True	Johan Karrento	Documentary, Crime, Drama	Putting Lipstick on a Pig	Finland, Estonia	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODY5YjEzNTEtZGIzMi00MDlkLWJhMmUtZGYyNjRiMzU0MDlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQ1OTM5NQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.2/10"}]	9	N/A	Cris Af Enehielm, Björn Ekstrand, Stig Grönlund	Johan Karrento	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

The entire world order of the village, where the most important thing is to own land and live as a peasant, changes with the Communist regime and their collectivization. The years 1945 to 1946 find Ilie Moromete aging, but still healthy. There are tensions between him and his second wife Catrina and Ilie's children from his first marriage. Niculae is the only one of the children who has gone to school. He's finished three high school years and stopped before the final year, because of the lack of money. What he wants most in this world is to finish his studies. He becomes a journalist and novelist and writes about the changing times he's seen.	\N	N/A	7.6	110 min	Romanian	16 Nov 2018	True	Stere Gulea, Marin Preda	Drama	Moromete Family: On the Edge of Time	Romania	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDc3Y2JhYTUtMTA5Yi00YjUxLWE1NDctYzg2NzM3MTA4NWFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTEyNzE3MjQ@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"}]	1,908	N/A	Horatiu Malaele, Iosif Pastina, Dana Dogaru	Stere Gulea	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9205986 	\N	4 wins & 4 nominations	You Are Here - A Come From Away Story is an intimate feature documentary that goes deep into the community of Gander, Newfoundland where 38 airliners carrying over 6,500 passengers were forced to land after the terrorist attacks on 9/11. The film pulls back the emotional layers surrounding the five days during which the community housed, fed and cared for the dislocated passengers (or the "come from aways" in Newfoundland parlance). While their stories were the inspiration for the extraordinary Broadway hit musical, Come From Away, the documentary, You Are Here, reveals first-hand accounts of the great kindnesses and energetic resourcefulness the community showed their unexpected guests. Their emotional and sometimes humorous story of compassion and generosity, born of a long history of rescuing and welcoming shipwrecked sailors, resonates with a legacy of healing and reconciliation for the world - especially for the survivors of those murdered on 9/11, and for the first responders who lost their own lives saving others on that fateful day.	\N	N/A	8.6	84 min	English, French	11 Sep 2019	True	Moze Mossanen	Documentary	You Are Here: A Come From Away Story	Canada	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWQ2ZTNkNGMtMDM1NC00ZWM3LTljZmQtNjY4NDIxYzE1NzRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI0NjI0Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.6/10"}]	338	$318,885	Beverley Bass, Reg Batson, Beulah Cooper	Moze Mossanen	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9220770 	\N	N/A	Izu Ojukwu's Power of 1 is now available on Amazon Prime Video for viewers in the US and UK. The political thriller, which is partly inspired by 2 Baba's shelved 2017 protests stars Alexx Ekubo in the lead role of Justin Aba, a socially conscious afro-pop artiste with a large following. When Justin Aba decides to use his influence to stage a protest against the policies of the incumbent government, he is drawn into a game of politics he didn't bargain for.

tt9225320 	\N	N/A	Synopsis Seth is an aspiring sorcerer from the Pompo Hills area. Like all wizards, he is an "infected," one of the few living beings who survived the contact of the Nemesis--creatures fallen from the sky that contaminate and decimate all those they touch. Being immune to them, Seth wants to become a Hunter and fight the Nemesis. But more than that, Seth wants to engage in a quest that goes beyond the simple hunt for monsters. He wants to find the Radiant, their presumed cradle. Aided by a faction of fellow sorcerers, he travels the world in search of the Radiant, under the harsh scrutiny of the Inquisition. (Source: MangaHelpers, edited) Background Radiant is based on the french Comic of the same name.	\N	TV-PG	6.7	1 min	Japanese, Hindi	06 Oct 2018	True	N/A	Animation, Adventure, Fantasy	Radiant	Japan	\N	\N	\N	series	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzhiZmI2ZWItMjE2Mi00YjQ2LTkyZTMtY2E2ODFlNmRhOTI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTU2NzIyNzE@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.7/10"}]	678	\N	Shawn Gann, Barry Yandell, Christopher Llewyn Ramirez	N/A	2018–	\N	N/A	2

tt9233172 	\N	1 win & 1 nomination	The Zharkov family-father, mother and two young sons-belong to the Dolgan community, one of the last indigenous peoples pursuing their traditional nomadic life in the extreme north of Siberia. The children used to be sent to boarding school, where they became estranged from their family and culture, but nowadays they can get homeschooling from teachers assigned to them by the Russian authorities. Seven-year-old Zakhar and his older brother Prokopy are the protagonists in this calm, observational film. Zakhar's first year of schooling is with Nelly, a young but serious teacher. She tells him about President Putin and the importance of mathematics, and he learns classical poems by heart. Zakhar is an inquisitive and intelligent boy. Each day, he has a hundred new questions about the world, and he's surprised to discover that his teacher doesn't have all the answers. These scenes take place against a backdrop of the vast, snow-covered tundra and observations of the Dolgans' everyday activities-herding reindeer and fishing are their principal livelihoods.	\N	N/A	8.1	72 min	Russian	17 Nov 2018	True	N/A	Documentary, Animation	How Big Is the Galaxy?

tt9266592 	\N	1 win & 2 nominations	Joseon is in disorder from uprisings and a power struggle surrounding King Yi Heon. To avoid assassination, a clown named Ha Sun is brought to the palace to take the place of King Yi Heon. Ha Sun looks almost identical to King Lee Hun. When Ha Sun was a child, his parents died during an epidemic; he was saved from starvation by a group of clowns and became one of them when he grew up, and during their performances he would play King Yi Heon, whom he greatly resembled. Now Ha Sun is nervous that someone in the palace will discover that he is not the real king. Meanwhile, he falls for the beautiful Queen Yoo So Woon. ~~The drama adaptation of "Masquerade", is a story that takes inspiration from "The Prince and the Pauper" by Mark Twain.

tt9267624 	\N	N/A	On April 18th, 2017, Larry Bassett refused to pay federal income taxes on over $1 Million, becoming the top tax resister in US history. In his defiance, he wrote letters to U.S. government agencies and representatives, announcing that his conscience will not allow him to pay for the US war machine. He knows that breaking the law will bring retribution from the government, and he accepts the consequences of his actions. In fact, he's begging for their retaliation as his family and neighbors worry about his safety. Larry is retired now and lives alone with his extensive art collection in a loft downtown. He spends his days provoking the government with emails and phone calls, desperately trying to arouse a response from the IRS. In order to live by his personal motto that "you are what you pay for" he redirects his inherited wealth to individuals, causes and charities around the world. This is the remarkable story of his mission to carry on the legacy of his peace activist parents by taking a stand against war through civil disobedience.	\N	N/A	8.0	57 min	English	17 Apr 2018	True	N/A	Documentary, Biography	The Pacifist	United States	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjdjNTg3YTMtZmU0Ny00YmQ1LWExMDMtYTZhYjEzMGQxMTM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk4MTQyNA@@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.0/10"}]	31	N/A	N/A	Alex Zhort	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9280458 	\N	N/A	The rock group from Cologne around front man Jürgen Zeltinger has now been touring around Germany for 40 years. He has lived an anarchic and excessive life. From prison to alcohol poisoning up to a neurological emergency, "Plaat" has survived and seen it all. He was never politically correct. But now the 69-year-old rides his e-scooter to the café to meet his friends. Learning new lyrics is becoming more and more difficult for him, but his songs have never lost their power to ignite. All the more so since he is nowadays accompanied by a young guitar player who takes the role of a surrogate son for him. The film is a tribute to a Cologne original that has remained true to himself and will now rock his autumn years full of relish.	\N	N/A	7.6	90 min	German	07 Feb 2019	True	Oliver Schwabe	Documentary	Asi mit Niwoh - Die Jürgen Zeltinger Geschichte	Germany	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjQxMTk1ZGYtMzZjZC00NTBiLTgyMDMtNDkxOTc3NDY0ZjU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEzNDA5ODc@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"}]	21	N/A	Jürgen Zeltinger, Dennis Kleimann, Arno Steffen	Oliver Schwabe	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9288924 	\N	2 wins & 1 nomination	The Cocaine Famine is an Irish black comedy about cocaine and the futility of nationalism. Two Irish drug dealers, Jacko and his much-maligned sidekick Niallser, drag a captured cockney rival into an abandoned shed in the depths of rural Ireland. A stash of cocaine has gone missing, supplies are running low, and Jacko has his mind set on who is responsible. Things don't look good for Andy, the prisoner from London. Especially since the vengeful Jacko has a mighty bone to pick with the English. One that goes all the way back to the Famine. The interrogation spirals into a fiercely nationalistic debate about Anglo-Irish history, increasing the threat that something truly terrible is going to happen. Set in an isolated shed, our three characters play out this absurd scene in real time. The result is a short film full of playful humour and hard-hitting historical facts.	\N	N/A	8.9	13 min	English	10 Nov 2018	True	Brian Martin	Short, Comedy, Crime	The Cocaine Famine	Ireland, United Kingdom	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTM1MWRhY2ItMDc1OS00ZGQ5LTg4NzgtOGM5ODYzMTZhNmMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDYwMTk2ODI@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.9/10"}]	72	N/A	Brian Martin, Manus Halligan, Glenn Speers	Sam McMullen	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9301886 	\N	N/A	Blackmoor is the name of a fictional world created by David Arneson. It is also the prototype of Dungeons and Dragons, the first published role playing game. Unlike other fantasy worlds, such as J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth, Blackmoor is a living world that is being explored to this day. Secrets of Blackmoor investigates the origins of the role playing game, through candid interviews, archival footage, and newly discovered artifacts. In 1964, David Wesely becomes a founding member of a club that includes history buffs, model makers, and miniature collectors. Hiding within the group, however, are a bunch of college students who are interested in war gaming. Within a year, the gamers meet a high school kid named Dave Arneson who is playing war games with his friends in his parents' basement. These gamers have no idea that they will change the face of this hobby forever. Their only concern for now, is how to simulate the reality of war, and above all, they just want to have fun. Their voracious hunt for new rules and knowledge leads them to the University of Minnesota Library where they discover an old manuscript, Strategos; the American Game of War. Within the dense pages are a few sentences that inspire them. The influence of Strategos changes how they play their war games. But are they really following these old rules, or have they stumbled onto something truly unique by misinterpreting what it says? Should a game be constrained by rules, like Monopoly, or should there be no boundaries at all, like a game of make believe? One thing is very clear--something magical was going on in the Twin Cities.	\N	N/A	7.7	128 min	English	08 May 2019	True	Griffith Mon Morgan III	Documentary	Secrets of Blackmoor: The True History of Dungeons & Dragons	United States	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDE5YjdmZmUtMDMzNC00ZGU5LWI2ODktNjY2NDE0ZjU3ZmZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjkzMjM0Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.7/10"}]	48	N/A	Dave Arneson, Griffith Mon Morgan III, John Arneson	Chris Graves, Griffith Mon Morgan III	2019	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9310182 	\N	N/A	I Reborn, a short silent without dialogues, opens a window to the world of an undertaker/dom who lives in isolation with his aged father in the backwaters of the Bay of Bengal. He carries on his duties as a son taking care of his immobile father breathing through his existence. His father observes his son continuing his own vocation as a medium that gives death its destination, cremating the departed relatives of the villagers nearby. Suddenly, one day, life enters their cocooned world in the form of a baby that gives a completely alien perspective to their outlooks. The cycle of life and death takes on a new meaning when a familiar face of a woman, who had aroused his inner craving for his own family, arrives as an abandoned corpse at his doorstep. I Reborn, is the awakening, rising, dying and the re-awakening of this eternal universal cycle that we all invariably travel on.	\N	N/A	9.8	21 min	N/A	04 Feb 2020	True	Manoj Michigan	Short, Drama	I, Reborn	India	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDVkZTNhYjItZWVkNS00ZWU2LTgxZTItYzU3N2I1NjczOWZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzk2NDA3NTA@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"9.8/10"}]	39	N/A	Haridass Chattopadhyay, Rupanita Das, Prosenjit Koley	Manoj Michigan	2020	N/A	N/A	\N

At 20 years of age, she had survived Auschwitz Birkenau, while 49 members of her family were murdered, including her mother, father, and little sister. Today, at age 90, Eva is asked to participate in a dance theatre performance about her life's journey. This would be her first experience performing on a stage. Reka, the director, imagines a duet between Eva and a young, internationally acclaimed dancer, Emese. Reka wants to see these two women, young and old, interact on stage, to see how their bodies, and stories, can intertwine. Eva agrees immediately. Three women - three months - a story of crossing boundaries. Whilst the extraordinary moments of Eva's life are distilled into theater scenes, a truly wonderful and powerful relationship forms among the three women.	\N	N/A	7.9	83 min	Hungarian	12 Sep 2019	True	N/A	Documentary	The Euphoria of Being	Hungary	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjcyMmIzNjEtN2Q4NC00NWRiLTllYTctZDFiMTM0MmRmMTVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjIzMDAwOTc@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.9/10"}]	129	N/A	Emese Cuhorka, Éva Pusztai-Fahidi, Réka Szabó	Réka Szabó	2019	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9316022 	\N	N/A	In old Betamax footage, the Polish-American artist Stanislav Szukalski (1893-1987) speaks animatedly about his life and work. Art aficionado Glenn Bray filmed his elderly friend in the last years of his life to document his remarkable career and personality before it was too late. In this wide-ranging portrait, Bray explains how he met Szukalski by chance in 1971 when he came across one of his expressionist drawings and discovered that its maker lived only a few miles away from him. The man leading a modest, anonymous life in Burbank, California turned out to have been a well-known avant-garde artist in Chicago and pre-war Poland. Szukalski created a mythology entirely of his own in his drawings and paintings, as well as an extensive manuscript. After his return to the United States, a group of artists and art lovers gathered around Szukalski, among them George DiCaprio and his son Leonardo, who jointly produced this documentary. The interviews and archive footage tell the extraordinary life story of a man who seemed to have been born for great things, but who lost virtually all his artwork in the Second World War. His past also includes a dark chapter that the filmmakers didn't discover until their documentary was in production.	\N	TV-MA	7.9	115 min	English	21 Dec 2018	True	Stephen Cooper, Ireneusz Dobrowolski	Documentary, Biography	Struggle: The Life and Lost Art of Szukalski	Poland, United States	21 Dec 2018	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NjUxMDU2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE2NTIwNzM@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.9/10"}]	4,582	N/A	Stanislav Szukalski, Glenn Bray, Robert Williams	Ireneusz Dobrowolski	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9324614 	\N	3 wins	2 Nations 1 Obsession - Synopsis In terms of rivalries in world sport, there is arguably none as fierce as that between the Australia and Indian cricket. The team at Dickson Films have travelled far and wide on both continents to explore this fascinating sporting rivalry - from its inception until the present day. We explore the stories behind the remarkable 1986 Tied Test in Madras, the gripping final over bowled by Greg Matthews plus the remarkable nature behind Dean Jones' double hundred. Fast-forward 15 years and the 2001 series between the nations is widely regarded as one of the best series ever played by Cricket purists. In particular, the dramatic Third Test where a plucky young off spinner named Harbhajan Singh ripped through Australia to take 15 wickets for the match, and lead India to victory. But it was the infamous 'Monkey Gate' scandal in the 2007/08 series where relations between India and Australia reached its lowest ebb. This feature length Documentary goes behind the scenes to hear the real stories from the stars themselves - how and why the incident was so highly publicised at the time. India was bullied by the likes of England and Australia for many decades, but in this documentary, the rise of India into a genuine powerhouse - is chronicled in fascinating detail. No longer is the BCCI seen as the poorer cousin to the cricketing giants - it now rules the game. Border, Gavaskar, Matthews, Gilchrist, Shastri, Clark are just a few of the names who feature prominently during this film. 2 Nations 1 Obsession isn't just an epic Cricket story - it's a tale of how two countries with such different DNA - can be brought together for the love of a game.	\N	N/A	8.6	100 min	English	21 Nov 2018	True	Peter Dickson	Documentary, Sport	2 Nations, 1 Obsession	Australia	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjE5NjQ3ODMtYTBhNS00YTM3LWExMjktOGUyMDUzODczMDAzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODAzNzAwOTU@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.6/10"}]	45	N/A	Peter Dickson, Bishan Singh Bedi, Harsha Bhogle	Peter Dickson	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9328476 	\N	2 wins & 3 nominations	Battering, breading, frying - Berta has prepared thousands of schnitzels in her old cast-iron pan over the years. This 83-year-old landlady's life on the family farm with adjoining guest house in the Oberpfalz has been marked by constant hard work. A life that her granddaughters Monika and Hannah never wanted to lead. Now, the deeply indebted farm is on the brink of collapse. Despite having an academic background and contrary to her intentions, Monika, in her early thirties, decides to give up her modern life and save the family business. The two women join forces and give themselves a year to sort out the farm's problems. The director Hannah Schweier accompanies their endeavour, as Berta and Monika are also the filmmaker's grandmother and sister, respectively. Schweier both tells the story and allows it to unfold while sensitively capturing the arduous everyday life on the farm. She uses her own family history as an opportunity to reflect on dreams, on getting older and letting go. A remarkably intimate and melancholic view of life.	\N	N/A	7.5	102 min	German	29 Sep 2020	True	Hannah Schweier	Documentary	80.000 Schnitzel	Germany	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWM5YWNkZDktMTc2Yi00OGQ4LTk2NDUtMjU1MjM1ZmM0Yzk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUwNjUwODQ@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.5/10"}]	41	N/A	N/A	Hannah Schweier	2020	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9362322 	\N	N/A	This production company blows me away. Over and over again, they manage to turn the tiniest amount of money into high-quality, entertaining content, and this short is no exception. I will say if you haven't watched A Tell Tale Vlog and Edgar Allan Poe's Murder Mystery Dinner Party, this probably won't make a lot of sense, so definitely check those out first. For fans of those series, this is a must-see. The performances of Sean Persaud, Sinead Persaud, and Mary Kate Wiles are among their best; the writing is brilliant as always; the literary references are particularly clever; the soundtrack is perfect; and the Poe Party reference jokes are absolutely delightful. In short, this was everything I wanted it to be and more, just like everything Shipwrecked Comedy creates.	\N	N/A	8.2	N/A	English	17 Dec 2018	True	Sean Persaud, Sinead Persaud	Short, Comedy	A Cryptmas Carol	United States	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTBlZTc1MmMtM2MwZi00MjdkLWJlMDctM2FlYjZmNmVkY2RmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY2MjMxODU@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.2/10"}]	10	N/A	Sean Persaud, Sinead Persaud, Mary Kate Wiles	William J.

The movie which opens with a soul pleasing shot of the river Brahmaputra with a ship ferrying, takes us to the river island and introduces us to the unvarying and routine life of Moukon, Luit, Simanta, Joi, Topon, and Bhaskar. Moukon, a young carefree girl finds herself at the center of some mysterious deaths after which she is socially considered a jinx. Simanta, Joi and his friends are well qualified but are still in search of a substantial life. Life is also indifferent for Luit who moves from door to door by selling insurance policies and has no better resolutions for the future.

tt9381432 	\N	N/A	The Sin of Being a Woman is the story of an indomitable woman who fought a relentless and uphill battle against prejudice, convention and authority at a difficult time in a difficult part of the world. The documentary delves into the life and work of Nezihe Muhiddin, one of Turkey's earliest and most vociferous feminists. It looks to tell her story and remind new generations of how much we owe this pioneering and amazing woman - who literally sacrificed her life for women's equality. The Sin of Being a Woman aims to ensure that Nezihe's incredible struggle and achievements -- which have been systematically downplayed, even erased, from memory and history books -- are documented and available in particular to young generations of women as they face their own gender inequality battles in its myriad forms today.	\N	N/A	6.7	60 min	Turkish	05 Dec 2018	True	Ahsen Diner	Documentary	Kadin Olmanin Gunahi/The Sin of Being a Woman	Turkey	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjBhMzNjMjItYzEzMy00NWEzLTlmZjktMTdlNTY4MWYxNTljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMyMjYyMTI@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.7/10"}]	30	N/A	Aysel Yildirim	Umran Safter	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

Witness mind-bending pillow lines as the crew camps out deep in the Purcell Mountains of British Columbia. Experience urban madness in Kamchatka and the insanity of the Crazy Mountains in Montana. Join the crew in the Slovenian Alps for over-the-head cold smoke and watch an 11-year-old rip Jackson Hole.

tt9426482 	\N	N/A	A unique portrayal of two young amateur actresses embarking on a journey that will forever change their lives as they star in the most eagerly anticipated new show of 2018-Elena Ferrante's My Brilliant Friend. Naples 2017. The news spread fast. Ferrante's saga, a worldwide phenomenon selling over 13 million novels, is about to become a major TV series for HBO and RAI. Thousands of young girls audition for the parts of the main characters Elena and Lila...but only two succeed. The lives of Margherita Mazzucco and Gaia Girace, cast as Elena and Lila, are about to change in an unimaginable way. An event within the event, this remarkable documentary captures the adventure these two non-actors will go on-from the open casting call of 2,500 hopefuls, through to the show's Venice Film Festival premiere. This is an exclusive look into them experiencing a true Cinderella story, where two unknown, ordinary teenagers embark on roles of a lifetime. The documentary is an intimate portrayal of this unique story, starting with the girls as complete strangers through to their journey of becoming close friends. It documents the transformation of two 15-year-old actresses, their friend-ship, the highs, the lows, the challenges, the rewards, the ordinary and the extraordinary. It is a genuine coming-of-age story as they learn their craft and become embedded in a world they only ever dreamed of. It not only explores the rapport between the two actresses, but also draws parallels to Elena and Lila's relationship and how at times the lines between reality and fiction, person and character, can blur.	\N	N/A	8.0	72 min	Italian, English, Neapolitan	06 Dec 2018	True	Clarissa Cappellani	Documentary	My True Brilliant Friend	Italy	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVmZDVmZmEtZmY1ZS00MzBhLWFlZTctYjBiMzJiZmFmZmEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODAyNjIyMw@@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.0/10"}]	417	N/A	Gaia Girace, Margherita Mazzucco, Antonio Calone	Clarissa Cappellani	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9436970 	\N	N/A	Suede's arrival in British music in the 1990s was a phenomenon. Fated as 'The Best New Band in Britain' before they had even released a single, their debut album was the biggest selling for a generation and their emergence and dominance heralded Britpop. Made with full access to the band and their unexpurgated, incredible archive, Suede: The Insatiable Ones is documentary-feature that tells their story with brutal honesty, humour and dignity. Pulling no punches, the film eschews a linear form for a themed journey through Suede's intense career, and its creative and personal highs and lows. Through five chapters it explores: their roots and identity; the rush of success and immediate, infamous internal power struggle and schism, which few thought they could survive; the subsequent commercial apogee and significant international success; the resultant excess and substance abuse; their 'slow painful death' and split; and - ultimately - their recent, brilliant, acclaimed artistic rebirth. Frontman Brett Anderson and the band are joined by a wonderful cast that includes founder member of Suede and Elastica, Justine Frischmann, Suede's early manager Ricky Gervais, early Suede drummer and ex-Smith Mike Joyce, alongside friends, family and collaborators including Richard Osman, iconic designer Peter Saville, and others.	\N	N/A	7.9	113 min	English	24 Nov 2018	True	Mike Christie	Documentary, Music	Suede: The Insatiable Ones	United Kingdom	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzBiZWQ4NjktZmM1Mi00NWM5LTg1NDktYTI0MTE2YzFhYTUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTgwMzI4NDY@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.9/10"}]	152	N/A	Brett Anderson, Bernard Butler, Neil Codling	Mike Christie	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9437984 	\N	N/A	From humanity's darkest moments came survival. From survival came light and the blooming of a new life. The Holocaust Education Film Foundation proudly presents "Surviving Birkenau," the story of Dr. Susan Spatz, née Eckstein, as told in her vivid and emotionally compelling own words at the age of 96. Born in Vienna in 1922, Susan Spatz was an only child who lived a life of privilege until the Nazis invaded Austria, and she and her mother found themselves "in the trap". Deported to Theresienstadt and ultimately interned at the notorious Birkenau death camp, Susan Spatz survived an astonishing three years before a long and brutal death march led her instead to liberation. In "Surviving Birkenau", Susan recounts her experiences with remarkable clarity; a story that began in her teens when a decision by her mother condemned her to death, and cost Susan 3 years in unbearable Nazi concentration camps. With the assistance of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, acclaimed filmmaker Ron Small (To Auschwitz and Back) brings Susan Spatz's story to the forefront for generations to witness.	\N	N/A	N/A	70 min	English	14 May 2019	True	David M.

The winner gets to travel to Spain - Picasso's birthplace - to hone their art. But entering the competition requires a fee that his parents cannot afford. With an ailing mother and a father struggling with debt and alcoholism, the chances of him being able to participate look slim. Gandharva's father Pandurang was once an accomplished stage actor, but his addiction now stands in the way of him performing, which was both his passion and a means to provide for his family. Will Pandurang be able to fight his demons and bring his art back to life - not for himself, but for his son? Picasso is a story about fathers and sons, hope and dreams - of life imitating art, and how art can heal lives.	\N	N/A	7.9	74 min	Marathi	19 Mar 2021	True	Abhijeet Warang	Drama	Picasso	India	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGNmMjI0ZjEtNjZhNS00MzgxLThiZjAtMDJlYWU4M2RkZDc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTM3MTQ3ODEw._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.9/10"}]	422	N/A	Prasad Oak, Ashwini Mukadam, Samay Tambe	Abhijeet Warang, Tushar Paranjape	2019	N/A	N/A	\N

What at first glance looks like a beautiful spa by the sea, the people of Varna simply call THE PIT. A cinematic portrait of the Bulgarian present and the investigation of a microcosm that stands for an entire society. The regular visitors of the basin are our protagonists: the taxi driver Dimtscho, who finds love at the pit at the age of 61. The retired musician Alexander, who wants to rent his rooms to tourists and tells us about his time as a womanizer. Genadi, who takes care of the pit like a loving caretaker and who lives his dream of running a petting zoo. And Bobi, who is homeless and who walks the streets at night at the pit. Individual biographies, touching personal stories, interpersonal conflicts and exciting discussions combine to form a diverse picture. World views and political convictions meet in the pit and tell of social change and stagnation on the edge of Europe.	\N	N/A	7.7	73 min	Bulgarian, Russian, German	13 Feb 2019	True	Hristiana Raykova	Documentary	The Pit	Germany	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZlZDljMjAtYzNmMS00ZmIwLTliNDMtNDAyMDYzZjA2ZjViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzgwMDU0MTk@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.7/10"}]	37	N/A	N/A	Hristiana Raykova	2019	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9503722 	\N	N/A	About a Teacher is an intimate and inspiring drama that candidly takes us through the personal journey of a new inner-city public high school film teacher who enters the profession oblivious to the actual demands of teaching in the inner-city, and unaware of his own shortcomings and biases. Within his first month of teaching, he recognizes that knowing his subject matter is one of the smaller components of the job. Overwhelmed, he plans to quit at the end of the first school year. But as he begins to get to know his students and invests in their stories and futures, he discovers that he must set aside preconceived notions of who his students are and what they "need," and instead respond to the unique individuals in front of him. Inspired by the filmmaker's real-life experiences as an inner-city film teacher, and featuring many of his former students in the cast and crew, About a Teacher paints a realistic portrait of the teaching profession, shedding light on the challenges and pitfalls that lead nearly half of teachers to leave the profession within the first five years (with inner-city public schools having nearly twice the attrition of more affluent schools), while simultaneously celebrating the deep rewards that this meaningful and noble profession can provide.	\N	N/A	9.0	112 min	English	07 Apr 2020	True	Hanan Harchol	Drama	About a Teacher	United States	17 Apr 2020	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWIxYThkZDMtNjAxZC00NTk4LWFlNGYtZjhjZjQxMDhkODY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODk1NTA3MjQ@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"9.0/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"100%"}]	44	N/A	Dov Tiefenbach, Tibor Feldman, Kate Eastman	Hanan Harchol	2020	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9577520 	\N	N/A	A centenary ago, Corinthian FC of London were to many the world's greatest side - sporting geniuses credited with popularising football around the world while championing fair play. Having first toured Brazil in 1910, they were returning in 1914 when news reached them of the outbreak of World War One. They returned home without kicking a ball - dodging torpedo fire en route - and to fight on the battlefields of France, losing more men than any club in history. A hundred years later, the Corinthian name lives on in two very different corners of the world: Corinthian-Casuals FC play beside the Surbiton dual-carriageway as amateurs in the semi-professional eighth tier of English football; while SC Corinthians Paulista - a club inspired by the legendary Corinthian FC visit in 1910 - are Brazil's richest and most successful professional club. Brothers in Football tells the extraordinary true story of how South London amateurs Corinthian-Casuals, set-out on a pilgrimage to finally play the historic match that was abandoned on the eve of the Great War. Little do they know that their pilgrimage will take them 6,000km across the world, from playing in front of 30 fans one week to 30 million the next.	\N	N/A	8.5	87 min	English, Portuguese	24 Jun 2020	True	Chris Watney	Documentary, Sport	Brothers in Football	United Kingdom	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODY3YmI4N2ItZjIwOC00ZjI3LTlmNzEtZGQyMDE3ZTkxNDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDA0NzcxOA@@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.5/10"}]	55	N/A	N/A	Chris Watney	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9581076 	\N	42 wins & 54 nominations	'We're waiting to grow old'. This sentence briefly sums up Yaoyun and his wife Liyun's bitter realization about their lives. They were once a happy family - until their son drowned playing by a reservoir. And so Yaojun and Liyun leave their home and plunge into the big city, although nobody knows them there and they cannot even understand the local dialect. Their adopted son Liu Xing does not offer them the comfort they had hoped for either. Defiantly rejecting his 'foreign' parents, he one day disappears altogether. The married couple are repeatedly enmeshed in their memories. Finally, they decide to return to the site of their lost hopes. In this family saga spanning three decades of Chinese history, the private and the political merge and the individual gets caught up in the gears of a society in the throes of constant change. Part melodrama, part critique of the times, this film takes us from the country's upheaval in the 1980s following the Cultural Revolution to the prospering turbo-capitalism of the present day. Told in sweeping tableaux, it makes visible the deep scars that lie beneath the surface of an ostensibly unbroken success story.	\N	N/A	7.7	185 min	Chinese	22 Mar 2019	True	Mei Ah, Xiaoshuai Wang	Drama	So Long, My Son	China	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDQ2OTcwYTQtYmViZS00MjkzLWIwNTAtODUwMmJkYjZhMDE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzI1NzMxNzM@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.7/10"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"88/100"}]	5,339	N/A	Jingchun Wang, Mei Yong, Xi Qi	Xiaoshuai Wang	2019	N/A	88	\N

This is a film compiled of never-before-seen footage from surfing's Golden Age, with outtakes and extras from some of surfing's most well known filmmakers to tell a history that has never been told before. "Spoons: A Santa Barbara Story" is an exploration of how one of the most significant corners of the world produced, and continues to produce, some of the most talented surfers and innovators.

tt9599124 	\N	N/A	On June 7, 2017 Emma Benoit decided her life wasn't worth living anymore. It was the summer before her senior year of high school and on the outside her life looked perfect. She was a stunning varsity cheerleader with a supportive family and lots of friends, but on the inside she was filled with darkness, depression and anxiety, and had never told a soul about it. A series of miracles saved her life, but a self-inflicted gunshot wound resulted in a spinal cord injury that left her paralyzed. Although extremely tragic, the incident propelled her on a mission to use her painful experience and ongoing recovery to help others find hope, while shining more light on the suicide epidemic that is taking the lives of 20 young people a day in the United States. In addition to Emma's inspiring story of recovery, the film also shares the stories of two remarkable young people who didn't survive their attempts; and we learn first hand from their families, friends, school officials and suicide prevention experts about the devastating impact suicides have on those who are left behind.	\N	N/A	N/A	N/A	English	05 Apr 2021	True	N/A	Documentary	My Ascension	United States	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E4NjY0ZDEtNTRkOS00ZDc1LWE0ZWMtNmQzMWE2NjlhY2Y3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc0MTYwNDA@._V1_SX300.jpg	[]	N/A	N/A	Emma Benoit, Frank Campbell, John Draper	Greg Dicharry	2021	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9617456 	\N	Nominated for 1 Oscar. 71 wins & 52 nominations total	FOR SAMA is both an intimate and epic journey into the female experience of war. A love letter from a young mother to her daughter, the film tells the story of Waad al-Kateab's life through five years of the uprising in Aleppo, Syria as she falls in love, gets married and gives birth to Sama, all while cataclysmic conflict rises around her. Her camera captures incredible stories of loss, laughter and survival as Waad wrestles with an impossible choice - whether or not to flee the city to protect her daughter's life, when leaving means abandoning the struggle for freedom for which she has already sacrificed so much.

tt9617752 	\N	1 win & 1 nomination	In snowbound Tokamachi, Japan, teenaged Akio Sakurai took refuge in his room, escaping to another world with a pair of headphones and a pile of Led Zeppelin records. Moving to Tokyo, Akio worked as a kimono salesman by day, but by night became "Mr. Jimmy," adopting the guitar chops and persona of Jimmy Page. For 35 years, Akio recreated vintage Zeppelin concerts note-for-note in small Tokyo clubs, until the "real" Jimmy Page stopped by one night, and Akio's life changed forever. Inspired by Mr. Page's ovation, Akio quits his "salary man" job, leaving behind his family to move to Los Angeles and join "Led Zepagain." Soon cultures clash, and Akio's idyllic vision of America meets with reality.	\N	N/A	7.9	113 min	English, Japanese	01 Sep 2023	True	N/A	Documentary	Mr. Jimmy	United States, Japan	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRlOWQyOWEtMDNiNy00Mzc1LWJlYzctNzNhNmVhMDMyMDc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzUwNDIxMjQ@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"100%"}]	54	N/A	Akio Sakurai, Rie Nakahara, Toshio Suzuki	Peter Michael Dowd	2023	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9630292 	\N	N/A	With more than 200 million stray dogs worldwide, volunteers are struggling to make a difference. Rescuing strays, aiding shelters, supporting spaying and neutering campaigns, adopting and fostering provide valuable relief, but the problem will persist, unless mentalities change. The Stray Story is a documentary feature project doing just that: raising awareness on the problem, inspiring people to change their mentality regarding animals, and motivating everyone to take action and make a difference. How? By taking the audience along an inspirational journey through the personal stories of four animal welfare volunteers, located in different countries around the globe. By opening a window to their lives and exposing their strengths, their weaknesses and their moving volunteer work. By shedding light on their struggles, their disappointments, their dark moments, but also on what motivates them, what lights their way and keeps them going. Ultimately, the documentary intends to inspire and motivate the audience to act, by exposing the change these few people bring in the world, armed solely with empathy and willfulness. Drawing important parallels between the treatment of dogs and people, the documentary reflects on the diminishing humanism of our society, in an age of commercialization and instant self-gratification. When everything, including man's best friend, comes with a price tag and is treated as disposable, what does that say about the human condition? Ultimately, this is not a documentary about strays. It is a story about humanity having gone astray.	\N	N/A	N/A	94 min	English, Greek	08 Aug 2021	True	Christina Georgiou	Documentary	The Stray Story: A Dogumentary	Cyprus	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzg1ZmVlODAtMzI2Mi00YWU2LWIxZWItYTdjNzEwNzE1OGI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA0OTIyMzg@._V1_SX300.jpg	[]	N/A	N/A	Takis Proestakis, Norma Torres, Nicos Kountouris	Christina Georgiou	2021	N/A	N/A	\N

His debts accumulate every day. Hisashi's old friend from the gang, Ozawa is a loan shark. He persuades Hisashi to join his easy-money-making scheme, "Quit inhaling paint thinner and score big with me!" Hisashi's dead-end life is made up of the same things that symbolize contemporary rural Japan: Karaoke clubs, pachinko parlors, ATM loan machines and discount outlets along a highway. In this ordinary place that is just like hundreds of other small towns in Japan, Hisashi sees the darkness. Darkness that is out of the reach of neon lights along the highway. In the vacuum of this darkness, life repeats itself endlessly. Hisashi has a flashback of a paint-thinner trip he once had. The hallucination tempts him to the other side.

Her experiences as a cyclist, as a mother, and in discovering the cargo bike world, teach Liz that sustainability is not necessarily about compromise and sacrifice and there are few things more empowering, in an age of consumption, than the ability to create everything from what seems to be nothing.

tt9662422 	\N	1 win & 2 nominations	They succeeded in making a dissident out of a poet that was so central to communist propaganda, that she was present in all literature manuals. A proletcultist artist, intelligent and with plenty of affairs, that was made to look just a feminist that opposed real socialism and criticized Ceausescu. She was a icon of the time and an activist for the communist cause. She had a very privileged status, thats why she was allowed to criticize the rulers. The old lady that she became shows no remorse, nor regret, she has nothing interesting to say about the intellectual and social atmosphere of the time. She portrays herself as an idealist. She did not leave the country until 1985. Her American partner is a nobody, from intellectual perspective and her life in NY was a failure, still she did not come back, probably because she could have been subjected to a lot of critics, for her support and for being a beneficiary of the communist regime. What I learned is that old age is not as we should expect an age of wisdom, nor one of introspection and doubt over what mistakes and what pathways one should have taken, nothing but a decaying body with a superficial mindset.	\N	N/A	8.1	89 min	English, Romanian	28 Nov 2018	True	Dana Bunescu, Mona Nicoara, Ada Solomon	Documentary	The Distance Between Me and Me	United States, Romania	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3YjJmMTMtN2YxNC00MGE0LWJhMmQtMTUzNmJmNDEwNTI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQxNjA1MzU@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.1/10"}]	132	N/A	Nina Cassian, Maurice Edwards, Mona Nicoara	Dana Bunescu, Mona Nicoara	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

In the 1960s, propaganda films warned parents of "predatory characters" at local parks under the guise of public service announcements. Anita Bryant's Save Our Children campaign in the 70's galvanized a coalition of conservative religious groups that spread the idea that sexual abnormalities would corrupt the nation and its children. The 80's AIDS pandemic further exacerbated fears about homosexuality and "making fun" became a way to marginalize those who were different, which subsequently generated anger, fear, violence and even murder against targets deemed inferior. Although the LGBTQ+ community has witnessed progress since the passing of Marriage Equality and award-winning LGBTQ+ shows and films have been embraced, the psychic damage to gay people is deep and events like the tragedy that struck the Orlando PULSE night club remind us that hateful propaganda can sometimes lead to deadly outcomes.	\N	N/A	7.0	76 min	English	02 Jun 2020	True	Craig Bettendorf	Documentary	HOMO.SAY.WHAT	United States	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWU3ZjUyNjMtM2RiYy00NTcxLTljMDktNDgwOTlhNzZmZDkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTg2MTY4ODY@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.0/10"}]	31	N/A	Sean Bowe, Jax Buresh, Kai Morgan	Craig Bettendorf	2019	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9676252 	\N	3 wins & 6 nominations	Technological advances and cultural development have disrupted the balance between humankind and other animals. Instead of looking at similarities, we focus on differences. Co-existence has been replaced by dominance. We have forgotten that we live in a house that does not belong only to us. However, the ties between humans and other inhabitants of the animal kingdom have not been irreversibly broken. In his visual essay, which is both intimate and philosophical, Alessandro Cattaneo focuses specifically on those things that connect us. The statements of thinkers and idyllic shots of interspecies interactions indicate that if we change the way in which we think about animals, it will be beneficial for the entire ecosystem.	\N	N/A	N/A	80 min	Italian	14 Sep 2019	True	Alessandro Cattaneo, Silvia Della Sala	Documentary	Res Creata	Italy	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTNmNDI4OTYtNmFmNC00NmZmLWI0Y2UtNTEyYmMyZTVmODEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjcyNDU4NTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg	[]	8	N/A	Felice Cimatti, Giovanni Lindo Ferretti, Dario Martinelli	Alessandro Cattaneo	2019	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9690830 	\N	5 wins & 4 nominations	His passion for combat sports wasn't keeping him alive so survival mode kicked in for Michael and he was forced to take normal jobs, including working in factories, slaughterhouses, demolition companies; in addition to working as an upholsterer, postman, tiler, plasterer, and salesman. In his later years though, Michael's career as a UFC fighter would take off and he would become one of the sports fan favorites, but with any combat sport comes the shrapnel of getting kicked and punched in the face on a nightly basis. In a controversial fight against the steroid-induced Victor Belfort, the unthinkable would happen to change the course of Bisping's life forever. He would suffer a detached retina from a blow and kick to the head that would disfigure and scar the fighter forever, threatening to end a career he has sacrificed everything for. With a wife and kids that love him, they plead for the battered and bruised fighter to hang up the gloves, as they feel he has nothing left to prove. But in the end that decision is left to only one man: Michael Bisping.	\N	N/A	7.6	110 min	English	22 Mar 2022	True	Scott Dodds, Michael Hamilton	Documentary	Bisping	Canada	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjJiNmMzMzktOWUzYi00MTBkLWI5Y2YtMGMwNjQ2YzE1NjU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk0ODg2OTM@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"}]	724	N/A	Scott Adkins, Michael Bisping, Karyn Bryant	Michael Hamilton	2021	N/A	N/A	\N

Created in 1994 by war surgeon Gino Strada, Emergency staff have helped save over 9 million lives around the world. From treating front-line injuries caused by explosions in Kabul, to the monotony of Refugee Camps in Iraq as well as their deployment on the MOAS rescue boats off the coast of Libya, the staff explain how they could not simply stay at home and do nothing knowing they could 'do something'. We see their laughter, tears and, at times, frustration doing what very few people are brave enough to do and we learn the hardships and emotional stress that they must endure to carry out their missions while never losing hope.	\N	N/A	N/A	86 min	English	03 Sep 2019	True	Sarah Burton	Documentary	Beyond the Beach: The Hell and the Hope	United Kingdom	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDJlZmI5MzUtMmFjNS00M2E5LThkNWQtMmZmOTI4MDMxNWZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMwMjU5NTUz._V1_SX300.jpg	[]	N/A	N/A	Gino Strada	Graeme Alistair Scott, Buddy Squires	2022	N/A	N/A	\N

His friends fly home while Anselm decides to continue the ride up north - alone. Cautious at his vulnerability to his surroundings at first, he gains confidence and learns to adapt to the various cultures and their way of life. Step by step his incredible path unfolds and leads him through 15 countries of the African continent and to extraordinary encounters. His bicycle becomes his gateway to local life: it invites communication and enables him to found and support projects that promote rural youth. His conviction to travel by his own strength, camp in unimaginable places and rely on intuition, leads him to exceptional adventures, but also to acutely experience fundamental issues. Besides night-time encounters with lions or hippos and repeated malaria and typhus infections, he struggles with water provision, discrimination and corrupted officials. He still faces the ultimate challenge - riding 3.000 kilometers through the Sahara against the relentless North Wind. After a year, 15.000 kilometers and 15 travelled countries, having fallen in love with this multi-facetted world, his journey faces an unpleasant end - ironically by people that would protect him against the "dangerous" continent.	\N	N/A	7.6	103 min	German, English	13 Dec 2018	True	Laia Gonzalez, Anselm Nathanael Pahnke	Documentary, Adventure	Anderswo.

tt9732770 	\N	N/A	One of the crucial elements of Kingdom Come: Deliverance is medieval combat, which we at Warhorse Studios developed similarly to the other aspects of the game, i.e. as faithfully as possible, in order to show how medieval warriors really fought. The documentary Fechtbuch is a record of what we learned in pursuit of that goal, and a guide to some of the secrets of historical martial arts. In the course of shooting this film, we asked the leading Czech and Slovak fencers and martial artists who assisted in bringing combat to life in our game to explain and demonstrate the basic principles and techniques of medieval combat. We will show you arms and armour, present various schools of swordfighting and, together with the combat masters, contemplate the significance of knightly learning in the past and today, six hundred years later. See what it looks like when a true master takes a sword into his hand.	\N	N/A	N/A	63 min	English, Czech, German, Polish, French	05 Feb 2019	True	Viktor Bocan	Documentary, History	Fechtbuch: The Real Swordfighting behind Kingdom Come	Czech Republic	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZjNzgzZmQtMmZjNC00MjMxLWFkNzgtNTYyMjMyOGU2MDRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0NzU2MDc@._V1_SX300.jpg	[]	11	N/A	Peter Koza, Petr Nusek, Petr Vytopil	Petr Spetla, Denisa Spetlova	2019	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9737848 	\N	N/A	The world of finance is at a crossroad. It is short-term traders versus long-term investors. Greed versus responsibility. Artificial intelligence versus human minds. For decades, the financial industry has been dominated by "wolves" seeking short-term personal gains. This has led to a destructive financial system, that has harmed millions of people. The world is faced with unprecedented problems: Food and water shortage. The effects of climate change. Mass migration and instability. Democratic values are under pressure. This far, finance has been seen as part of the problem. But can it be part of the solution? As the most powerful tool available to us, finance has the potential to fundamentally change society. As the world largest state-owned fund, The Norwegian Oil Fund is owned by a people and governed by politicians. It is a fund for future generations with ethical guidelines. It owns 1.5% of the worlds stocks and has ownership in 9000 companies worldwide. Instead of being part of the quarterly tyranny of regular businesses, this fund is politically mandated to see decades ahead. The fund has to address the coming challenges, but can - or will - the Oil Fund make a difference?	\N	N/A	8.2	68 min	English	28 Feb 2019	True	Fredrik Horn Akselsen, Asle Skredderberget	Documentary	Vikings vs. Wolves - The Battle of Finance	Norway	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjIxMTNjODctOWU2NC00Mjk2LWIzZDgtOGUzYTM3NWI2MDIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzAxODk2MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.2/10"}]	21	N/A	Kristin Halvorsen, Sony Kapoor, Vaishali Lara Kathuria	Fredrik Horn Akselsen	2019	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9740722 	\N	4 wins	Finding Courage is a character-driven documentary told by Yifei Wang, a former journalist for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) regime. Her family has been torn apart for practicing the Falun Gong spiritual discipline, which was ordered to be "eradicated" by former regime dictator, Jiang Zemin. During the nationwide eradication campaign, Yifei was arrested, her sister was murdered, and her brother was sentenced to 13 years in prison. Yifei was able to escape China with the help of her high-profile journalist husband and faces mental anguish of living in exile in the USA. After having escaped to America, Yifei seeks to hold the CCP accountable for the murder of her sister. Gordon, Yifei's husband, covertly seeks to record evidence at the labor camp in China where Kefei had been tortured to death to implicate the CCP and the camp in the crime. Despite his wife Sophia's wishes after being released from prison, Leo builds a chair he had been tortured in while being detained, even through the painful memories of the past that it provokes in both of them. He plans to use the chair to bring media attention to what is happening in China. Against all odds, Yifei and Leo must find the courage to recall their traumatic experiences and to expose the persecution still raging on in China in their own way. Will Leo's wife come to support him in his efforts to build the chair? Will their family finally be able to indict the murderer of Kefei? In their journeys, they find strength in each other, and hope for all of China.. Woven through the family narratives are interviews with ex-Chinese officials-including a former judge, director of a labor camp, national security agent from China's Gestapo-style "6-10 Office." They offer a rare insider look into into the regime's system of totalitarian rule that few outside, and within China know about.	\N	N/A	9.9	80 min	English, Chinese	18 Sep 2020	True	Kay Rubacek	Documentary	Finding Courage	United States	30 Jun 2022	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODJjZWE0NDMtYTNjOC00MWJlLThhODQtMzlkZTU0NmI4MTViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTE1NzIwNjY@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"9.9/10"}]	9	N/A	N/A	Kay Rubacek	2020	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9747800 	\N	1 win & 1 nomination	Aulcie tells the inspiring story of Aulcie Perry, a basketball legend who led Maccabi Tel Aviv to an upset win in the European Championship. During the summer of 1976, Aulcie Perry was spotted by a scout for Maccabi Tel Aviv while playing at the Rucker courts in Harlem and was quickly signed to play for their fledgling team. The Israeli players immediately responded to Aulcie's leadership and that year they had what one Sports Illustrated writer described as "the most extraordinary season in its remarkable history" and what Perry later called "the best nine months of my life." In 1977, Perry helped the team to its first European Championship, a prize they took four years later again under his leadership. After the season, to the surprise of many, Aulcie Perry converted to Judaism, adopted the Hebrew name Elisha Ben Avraham, and became an Israeli citizen. This inspiring film tells the story of this remarkable athlete who captured the spirit of a nation, triumphant and victorious against all odds, and put Israel on the map.	\N	N/A	8.5	75 min	English, Hebrew	16 Jan 2020	True	Dani Menkin	Documentary, Sport	Aulcie	United States, Israel	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTc1ZDg1MGUtMDZlZS00ZDM0LTgzYTItOWFhYzlhNjI2Mjc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjMyMzI4MzY@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.5/10"}]	19	N/A	Aulcie Perry, Tami Ben-Ami, Shmuel Mahrovsky	Dani Menkin	2020	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9753072 	\N	N/A	Two months after Pearl Harbor and the US entry into World War II, a pair of destroyers escort a supply ship through the treacherous North Atlantic to a base in Newfoundland. A brutal winter storm, combined with an officer's reluctance to trust his experienced navigator and newfangled radar, runs two of the ships aground on the cliffs of adjacent coves. More than 200 sailors on the USS Pollux and USS Truxton lose their lives, but nearly as many are rescued by local miners and townspeople, risking their own lives on the rocks and the raging seas. By the end of 24 hours of grueling rescue effort, at 2 remote locations, nearly every home has a sailor in the parlor. Director Terry Strauss, whose father was one of the survivors, plumbs a trove of photographs, documents, drawings, and interviews to recount a moving story of sacrifice, endurance, and heroism. The film hits an emotional peak with footage of the 1988 reunion between the American survivors and the Canadian townspeople who saved and cared for them. Peter Coyote narrates this remarkable saga with a blend of tender empathy and palpable amazement.	\N	Not Rated	N/A	88 min	English	02 Feb 2021	True	N/A	Documentary	As If They Were Angels	United States	31 Jan 2021	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjIyNmZmNTYtMGIwNC00ZTRhLTk5Y2EtYWFkZGNhMjRlZTc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjExMjc4OTY@._V1_SX300.jpg	[]	11	N/A	Peter Coyote	Terry Strauss	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9768966 	\N	N/A	"I originally set out to make a documentary to explore the positive benefits of control or diminished use. What I actually uncovered was something far far darker" - Richard GrannonPlugged In explores how social media and smart phone usage has an effect on our younger generations, those who are now born into a world technologically ready and know nothing else - and how hard it is to remove this element from their lives in these modern times. It looks into the design of social media being a purposeful tool used to keep people hooked in, taken away from face to face reactions and how the attitudes towards people through these mediums have become darker.This topic is one that is very relevant and asks the question of what will happen if we continue to increase the use of social media, the effect this will have on our interactions from person to person and the nature of lifestyles in the future. It also asks if these forms if media were moderated and limited how peoples lives would change for the better, bringing us back the interactions of our older generations."Plugged In" is presented and produced by Richard Grannon - a Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) master practitioner and has helped thousands of people by running courses to address mental health and overcoming narcissistic abuse. The project also heavily features SamVaknin, who is an author writing material around narcissistic personality disorders.About Richard GrannonRichard Grannon, NLP (neuro-linguistic programming) Master Practitioner, is passionate about helping people defend themselves, get back on their feet, and finally free themselves from narcissistic abuse. Richard attended Aston University, where he studied Psychology and trained under Richard Bandler, the co-developer of Neuro-Linguistic Programming. Much of Grannon's specific interest in narcissistic abuse originally stemmed from personal relationships - he'd witnessed it firsthand before and could tell something that something was wrong or "off," yet he couldn't quite identify it. It was only through his psychological training that he began to recognise patterns of narcissistic abuse.About Brick In The Wall MediaBrick in the Wall Media is a new company, established 2018 tocreate feature length documentary films, short films for businesses called "Mini MarketingMovies" and many other types of video work. It was founded by RichardWillett - A documentary filmmaker and media marketing manger, Danny Cotton - An award winning narrative feature filmmaker, and Phil McSweeney - who has worked in many senior leadership roles helping new business and startups.	\N	N/A	7.1	53 min	English	23 Jan 2019	True	N/A	Documentary	Plugged in	United Kingdom	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODgyOTFlNjgtMjdkMC00NTY5LThlN2QtODE2MDQxZjMxMjFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTgxNzAzOTE@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.1/10"}]	56	N/A	Richard Grannon, Sam Vaknin	Richard Willett	2019	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9772546 	\N	N/A	Power Meri follows Papua New Guinea's first national women's rugby league team, the PNG Orchids, on their journey to the 2017 World Cup in Australia. These trailblazers must beat not only the sporting competition, but also intense sexism, a lack of funding, and national prejudice to reach their biggest stage yet. Proud, strong and hopeful, the pioneering women in the PNG Orchids team have overcome more challenges than most to play their much-loved national sport. But after years at grassroots level, they have just three months to transform themselves into a competitive national team. Power Meri takes audiences on a journey through rarely-seen corners of PNG and behind the scenes of women's sport. It follows the Orchids through selection trials, arduous training with a fly-in-fly-out Australian coaching mentor, and diverse personal struggles as they face the world champion Australian Jillaroos and compete at the world cup. But their mission is greater than winning. In a country with appalling rates of domestic violence, sport is one of the few arenas in which PNG women can show their strength. If they can perform like men on the rugby field, can they change attitudes about the treatment and status of women back home?	\N	N/A	N/A	78 min	Tok Pisin, English	15 Sep 2018	True	N/A	Documentary	Power Meri	Australia	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWI1YzhhNjctNTFkZS00NmVlLWJlYmItMWFmZjFmMDE1ZjBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzYzMjk5NDI@._V1_SX300.jpg	[]	11	N/A	N/A	Joanna Lester	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

The unedited film is the starting point of a journey across the universe of Pasolini. Non-conventional rebel and provocateur, persecuted by the censorship, praised by the critic and eventually the mainstream: from his very first film "Accattone" (1961) to the last scandalous "Salò" (1975), Pasolini fearlessly investigates burning social topics such as sexuality and the end of the grand ideologies. Inexhaustible lover of life, in all its forms, poet, philosopher, filmmaker. His revolution scandalous and candid, his sensibility ancient yet modern. A unique voice in the cultural scene of the 20th Century, and one of the most important figures of the Italian "New Wave."	\N	N/A	8.4	60 min	French	11 Feb 2017	True	Christopher Jones, Valentino Misino, Marie-Dominique Montel	Documentary	Pasolini Motore!

tt9804080 	\N	N/A	Life is a unique event and it only happens to us once. There is no turning back. What would I have done or not done, if I could turn back time? Which of my actions or oversights have I regretted? I wonder, did I live well or did I waste the amount of time given to me? Important people, sculpted over time and standing at the threshold of life, talk, freely at last, about the journey of their life and bestow, as a gift, the precious essence of their life. The almost distilled opinions of these people are dramaturgically included in the fictional part of the documentary. Where the journey of life on Earth unfolds through the narrator's voice, while we follow the course of a child alongside a small wooden boat: from the springs of a river to the mouth of the sea, corresponding to Man's voyage from birth to death.	\N	N/A	8.0	77 min	Greek	07 Mar 2019	True	Dinos Giotis	Documentary	Mia zoi	Greece	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmE2NmY5YmYtMGIzMi00YTg3LTg2NmYtODFiNTRlNDRmZTk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTg2ODM1NzA@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.0/10"}]	10	N/A	Katerina Anghelaki-Rooke, Babis Bizas, Konstadinos Despotopoulos	Dinos Giotis	2019	N/A	N/A	\N

Thus, we enter an invisible border, always displaced, between white and black, between life and death, between those who shoot and who is filmed, between an outsider and a resident, between one generation and another. John refuses a dividing line between these two worlds and makes his own images on the cell phone. In the eyes of a tripod-narrator, he has small steps, a shyness that contrasts with the shrewd look when it is his turn as an observer. A boy who proposes and frui, still without assuming, all at the same time, in superimposed attitude. John is Negrinho, but he is also John, double in himself as well as all there, including the very city that he has just met and strange.	\N	N/A	N/A	74 min	Portuguese	14 Apr 2019	True	Thaís Inácio	Documentary, Biography, Family	I Do Not Know What City Happens in His Eyes	Brazil	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2UxMDQyYzMtZDIxMi00MTZjLTlhZWQtNmQ0ODNhZjZmZDc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzAwOTc5NjI@._V1_SX300.jpg	[]	N/A	N/A	Cláudia Barbot, Dona Ilídia, Marcus Liberato	Thaís Inácio, João Mendonça	2019	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9848972 	\N	3 wins	Enter Hal's world of Sydney's Eastern Suburbs where 20 years of insane increases in property prices has realized a weirdly dichotomous socio-economic melting pot. Here, amidst the pristine beaches, parks and gullies of Bondi, Tama, Bronte, Clovelly, Coogee and Maroubra live the exceptionally rich yuppie newcomers, often nestled next door to the original "old school" low to middle class "tradie" community. The rivalry, tensions and humour that spring from the glaringly obvious differences between the haves and have nots only serves to increase the pressure of the life choices these young men and women have to make - choose the path in life that guarantees them a "place at the table", or follow your heart and chase your dreams. The audience will be bustled along a wild ride with our sleepy anti-hero Hal's final days of year 12, where the normally studious and responsible elder sibling of a one parent family has been granted the chance to finally let his hair down. Suddenly (and unexpectedly) Hal is also faced with the opportunity to chase his dreams by auditioning at the age of only 17 for the prestigious National Academy of Performing Arts. Overwhelmed, Hal initially chooses (out of fear of failure) to ignore the moment afforded to him and opt for the patently ridiculous option of partying all night. Along with his hilarious slacker besties and larrikin footy mates (and the surprise appearances of his two younger brothers exploring their own particular stages of adolescence), a night of teenage chaos ensues. By nights end, Hal has learned not only who he is, what he might achieve (with a little help from his friends) but learns to own what he truly wants - and the courage required to chase his dream. He might even get the girl.	\N	N/A	7.9	99 min	English	23 May 2019	True	Hal Cumpston	Comedy, Drama	Bilched	Australia	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU1MjgzNmUtOTk5NC00ODYyLWE4MzgtZTgzMzgwYzU4M2JiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzYwOTQxMjg@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.9/10"}]	42	N/A	Hal Cumpston, Frederick Du Rietz, Mitzi Ruhlmann	Jeremy Cumpston	2019	N/A	N/A	\N

The 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, known as the SixTripleEight, was the only all-black female battalion to serve in Europe during WWII.

From the forests of Romania to the coastline of the Atlantic Ocean, he heads off in search of a new territory, a new pack and a new family. This is the incredible story of Slava, the wolf. This film tells also the story of a wolf in the Anthropocene. That of a 21st century wolf, who adapts to the world's new rules. A wolf who constantly comes up against Man. Faced sometimes with his brutality, his constructions, his roads, his factories. This documentary, based on real facts, directed by Vincent Steiger, will bring us to think about the future of the wolf, but moreover, about the relationship our society has with "the wild".	\N	N/A	8.5	90 min	French	09 Mar 2019	True	Anne-France Dautheville, Vincent Steiger	Documentary	L'Odyssée du Loup	France	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIwZDA5NGQtMWQ2MC00OWI2LWI3Y2MtODBiNWQ0ZTAxMGRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk5ODc2Mzk@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.5/10"}]	78	N/A	Kad Merad	Vincent Steiger	2019	N/A	N/A	\N

When he pushes her too far, she reaches out for help from Jung Won, an honest, smart, handsome plastic surgeon. And when he agrees to help her escape from her husband's hands, they fall in love. But In Wook, who is consumed by his obsession for her, isn't going to let her get away from his grasp.

The film deals with the history of the First Company of the Maidan, which defeated the enemy within and advanced to the frontlines to fight the external enemy. Immersion in the epicentre of events, a frank artistic and civilian view of human relationships against the background of violent social upheaval. Immutable human stories, the collision of charismatic characters, challenges and solutions on the verge of life and death, the search for interaction, the first steps towards the formation of civil society - All of this is summed up by an understanding of the way already travelled and an optimistic view of Ukraine's future.	\N	N/A	N/A	100 min	Ukrainian, Russian	21 Mar 2019	True	N/A	Documentary	The First Company	Ukraine	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmJmM2YxOWYtYWY5Yy00M2Q4LTgyYjgtZjY4NzY1Y2RhZGJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjk1NzAxNg@@._V1_SX300.jpg	[]	25	N/A	N/A	Yuri Gruzinov, Yaroslav Pilunskiy, Yuliya Shashkova	2018	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9881392 	\N	N/A	A bomb hits. The windows vibrate - and a few minutes later, the needle starts humming again. In a city full of conflict, Poko Chaim and Daniel Bulitchev, two Russian tattoo artists, have created a place where there are no walls. Here, they eternalize the stories of the inhabitants of Jerusalem; the ink beneath the skin connects them all. A glance at their tattoos sheds a whole new light on the heart of the Holy City - it's inhabitants. The studio is open to everyone, regardless of nationality, religion or the color of skin. The conversations, which take place under painful circumstances, often resemble confessions, the customers offer intimate insights into their lives in this controversial city, their beliefs and their fears in this continuous conflict which makes up their everyday lives. There are moments when Poko and Daniel are almost like psychologists and artists at the same time. To escape the constant sound of the needle, they take us to special places in the city, to the sea in Tel Aviv and on big Harleys into the mountains surrounding Jerusalem.	\N	N/A	N/A	75 min	English, Hebrew, Arabic	09 May 2019	True	Tom Fröhlich	Documentary	Ink of Yam	Germany	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFkZDYyZTAtYzhhYy00ZWEyLWE1MzQtZjI3NzVmNGY5YzU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMDA0NDEw._V1_SX300.jpg	[]	5	N/A	N/A	Tom Fröhlich	2017	N/A	N/A	\N

tt9914642 	\N	N/A	ALBATROSS is a powerful visual journey into the heart of an astonishingly symbolic environmental tragedy. On one of the remotest islands on our planet, tens of thousands of baby albatrosses lie dead on the ground, their bodies filled with plastic. Returning to the island over several years, our team witnessed the cycles of life and death of these birds as a multi-layered metaphor for our times. This story is framed in the vividly gorgeous language of state-of-the-art high-definition digital cinematography, surrounded by millions of live birds in one of the world's most beautiful natural sanctuaries. The viewer will experience stunning juxtapositions of beauty and horror, destruction and renewal, grief and joy, birth and death, coming out the other side with their heart broken open and their worldview shifted. Stepping outside the stylistic templates of traditional environmental or documentary films, ALBATROSS takes viewers on a guided tour into the depths of their own spirits, delivering a profound message of reverence and love that is already reaching an audience of millions of people around the world.	\N	N/A	8.2	97 min	English	22 Apr 2018	True	Chris Jordan, Victoria Sloan Jordan	Documentary	Albatross	United States	N/A	N/A	\N	movie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODMwODBmMWMtMGM2MC00NTA2LWI2MzMtNmNiZmU5MzRkZDUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzMxODQzODQ@._V1_SX300.jpg	[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.2/10"}]	37	N/A	N/A	Chris Jordan	2017	N/A	N/A	\N
